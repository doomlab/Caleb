\f0\fs24 \cf0 My name is Dominic Masek and I am currently a freshman at the wonderful Missouri State University. I am from St. Louis, Missouri. My favorite sport teams are the New York Giants, St. Louis Blues, and the St. Louis Cardinals (sorry to all the Kansas City fans out there). Some things about me that you should know is that I love playing soccer, I love music, and I also love going camping. I have loved the game of soccer for about fifteen years. I played for four years in high school at Pattonville. I had the pleasure of playing all of my four years on the varsity team. We were never really anything too special, until we got to my senior year. With a lot of hard work and dedication we were able to achieve winning Districts and only losing a total of three games throughout our entire season. This was definitely one of the highlights of my high school career. I also love music, i listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite has to be rap. Mainly because it can always get me really hype and put me in a good mood. I also love going camping with my family. We have probably been to almost every campground in the Missouri area. This one of the many ways our family bonds together and what better way then enjoying the great outdoors. These are all of the things I like for the most part. Other than that there isn't much to me. Actually, there are a few other things that I like doing and that is playing fantasy football. I play it every football season with my friends. Lat year I came in seond place and won $80. It was one of the main highlights from last year. \
