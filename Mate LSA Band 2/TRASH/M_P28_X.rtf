\f0\fs24 \cf0 My ideal date is just any chance I get to spend time with my partner. It doesn't have to be a fancy dinner or an expensive outing. It could be a Netflix date in sweatpants for all I care, as long as I'm happy and they're happy, that's all that matters to me. Not every date has to be grandiose and special, sometimes something simple and low brow is preferred. Really I'd be satisfied with anything as long as my partner was happy. Obviously if at all possible I'd prefer to not spend too much money, but as long as it wasn't overboard, I wouldn't mind dropping some cash on a nice restaurant or a gift or something. Even my ideal partner isn't something I can be particularly specific about, I don't really have a "type". If they're cute, and they're nice, and they make me happy, they fit into my type. I've noticed I tend to have a thing for redheads or dyed hair, but other than that, there aren't really any specific traits I do or don't look for in a person. Just no obsessive clingyness, I will draw a line there. Not only is it really obnoxious, it's kinda unhealthy and I don't want to deal with it anymore than I have in the past. }
