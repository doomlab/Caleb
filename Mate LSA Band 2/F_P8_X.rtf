\f0\fs24 \cf0 A perfect date would be something super simple but also thoughtful. I don't want him to spend a ton of money on me but I want it to be something that required planning and not just a trip to the movies. While anything can be fun if you're with the right person, my perfect date would not be the movies. I think something that would be really fun is doing something silly like mini golfing and then going on a walk or something and watching the sunset or something cheesy. My ideal romantic partner would be someone that is funny and caring; someone who can make fun of themselves and isn't too cocky that they can't take a joke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    }
