\f0\fs24 \cf0 The perfect date with my ideal romantic partner is not something I think about often. Me and my boyfriend are both very busy people so we rarely have time to stop and have an actual date together. I guess my ideal date would actually be a weekend. I work 70 hours a week and have not been able to go on vacation in years, so I would love to visit the aquarium in Georgia with him. I would love to fly down on a Friday and spend the whole day Saturday at the aquarium. I don't like being stressed out or pressed for time so I wouldn't want to have to go back to Springfield that day. I would love to be able to be there as soon as the aquarium opened, and get a map and make a game plan so that we would be able to hit all the fun spots within the aquarium. I would also like to go sit down for dinner, not at an expensive restaurant but maybe somewhere on the beach outside. I haven't seen the ocean since I was 5 or 6 so I would love to be able to see the ocean and maybe even walk in it some. I am however terrified of large bodies of water, so I don't think I would want to swim in it. So it isn't very detailed but that would be my ideal date.\
