In this generation, people my age do everything through technology and I hate it. It makes me have the belief that none of us can have face to face conversations which I believe is an important skill to have because a person needs to be able to talk to their significant other, boss, friends, family, etc. face to face when they have something important to talk about. Anyway, on the night of the date he would pick me up from my house and come to my door (or my dorm if that is where I'm living). He wouldn?t just wait in his car and text me ?I?m here? when he arrives. This once again takes it back to my generation using technology for everything. I think it would mean a lot for a guy to actually get out of his car and knock on my door to signal that he is here instead of sending a text. When we arrive at his car, he would open my door before he goes to the driver side to get in. We would both be somewhat dressed up for this date, not super fancy but also not super casual. I like putting effort in to look nice for impotant things so it would be a positive thing if the guy did too. If the guy dresses up it shows me that he actually took the time to prepare for the date and put the effort in to dress up. In the car, it wouldn't be awkward because we would be able to have a continuous conversation. I would also really appreciate if the guy already had where we were going to eat picked out and didn?t just say we were eating wherever I decided. Im a very indecisive person when it comes to making decisions so anytime someone takes the time to choose something I would like instead of making me it is nice. It would also prove to me that the guy put thought into what he thought would be good plans for the date. The dinner will be good with good conversation. After dinner, we wouldn't see a movie because then we both just sit there without the chance to talk and get to know each other better. Instead, we would do something more active and fun. This could be anything like bowling or mini golf. It gives us the chance to talk but also goof around. When it was time for the date to be over, he would drive me back to my house (or dorm) and say good night."

I would hope she is very friendly and very caring as well. My ideal date would be to eat dinner one night and then attend a concert of an artist we both like. I love going to concerts because they're full of energy and excitement and everyone is just there to have fun. I, of course, have favorite artists and genres of music but I would love to see some of her favorite artists in concert or just go to a concert of an artist we both enjoy. My favorite concerts I've been to have been either The Lumineers or Twenty One Pilots. Both were vastly different when compared to each other but both were great shows. Prior to the concert, I'd like to go to a sit-down restaurant to eat dinner. I'd like to eat at a restaurant we both enjoy. My favorite concert venues are the Hollywood Casino Amphitheater in St. Louis and the Midland Theater in Kansas City, so I'd like to attend a concert at either of them. The Amphitheater is really cool since it is outside and it has a large stage, but the Midland Theater is also neat due to it being a smaller, more compact building, so you're close to the stage no matter where your seat is. The Midland is also in the middle of the Power & Light District of Kansas City so it's very vibrant and colorful especially at night time and during an event. Both of these venues are amazing and I always have a great time when I attend either one of these with my friends. Another different ideal date for me would be to attend a sporting event together. I love all types of sports but my favorite teams are the Chiefs and the Royals. My favorite sporting events to attend, however, are Sporting Kansas City soccer games. The fans at soccer games are crazy and electric and are really a sight to see, especially when the home team is winning. One of my favorite sporting events I've ever been to was USA Men's soccer game against Bolivia in the summer 2016. The atmosphere around the stadium was amazing and the fans there were amazing and were really into the match. Either of these would be my perfect date with my ideal romantic partner.                                                                   "

Ever since I was very little I loved getting all dressed up when I was little it was princess dresses and my moms old purses and as a got older it became makeup, nails, and expensive dresses. I would love to have an occasion to dress up completely to get my hair done, flawless makeup, nails done, a very elegant long dress and fancy heels. I would love to be taken out all done up to a big fancy ballroom. The type of ballroom you might have seen in Beauty and the Beast or any other princess movie. I would love the ballroom to have shiny marble floors and for the lights to be dimmed. Its been a dream date of mine since I was little to show up to one decorated, fancy table for two in the ballroom. I love intimacy not in the way you are thinking of but I love it In the way that you become so close to someone, I love deep meaningful conversations. I love the undivided attention free from distractions that are always surrounding us in everyday life; no phones, no one else, no multi-tasking. A nice dinner, full of class where everything falls into place perfectly just like the movies. I then want to sit and talk about everything under the moon, I wanna know everything about you and I want you to know everything about me. I love the questions that make you really think and really dig into your feelings. I have absolutely zero coordination especially when it comes to dancing but I think there is something so romantic and pure about slow-dancing. I want it to be just like the movies and the music videos. With music playing like 'thinking out loud' by ed Sheeran, or anything to fit the mood. I just want to spin around the ball room in a long elegant dress that will flow with any movement, and in the end I want to be pulled back in close and just look into the eyes of my ideal guy. In that moment I feel like time would pause and everything would be pure, simple, and perfect, and I love that. Then there would be some type of special dessert and we could talk even more, then since this is a perfect date there would be a balcony where we could stand outside under the stars and just stare into the sky and get lost in the moment."

I enjoy doing things that both me and my romantic partner enjoy doing. It would start with getting ready and dressing up. I would probably wear a blue dress, curl my hair, and have simple makeup. He would wear khakis and a button down. In college, so many days are spent in athletic clothes. It makes the occasion more special and important. We would go out to dinner, bonus points if my romantic partner makes reservations. Somewhere somewhat nice, but not too nice and fancy where I feel bad for going there. I think it would be fun if I picked what he got and he picked what I would get. I would enjoy walking around after dinner, enjoying each other and all of the things around us. It would be fun if there was some sort of festival going on, where we could walk around and look at different crafts, art, and talents. If the temperature was in the low 70s with a light breeze, I would not complain. After the walk, the perfect thing would be to go to the World's Largest Fork in Springfield, Missouri. It is actually where we ended up on one of our first dates, so it has a lot of meaning to it. Plus, it is the coolest thing in the world. We could just sit there and talk about anything and everything. If Thomas Rhett just happens to be playing in the background, that would make it a little better. After the World's Largest Fork, we could go get a sweet treat from Andy's or Hurts Donuts. I would get vanilla ice cream with snickers. He would get something chocolate, and wouldn't mind if I tried some of his. We would probably drive to a nearby lake and just look out. If somehow he had a convertible, I wouldn't mind. With the wind blowing through my hair and the radio turned up, it would make things a little more fun. I think it is all about who you spend your perfect date with, not what you do during your perfect date. I would pick a simple date with the person who I want to be with over an elaborate date with anyone else. It is the thought that counts, that both people are enjoying their time, and that they want to go on another date again. I think we get so caught up in society's goals for relationships that we forget to look at what we want from a relationship. I want someone who cares and loves unconditionally, who will be there in the worst moments and the best moments, and who will make me a better version of myself. Not one date could do that, but the perfect date would be a date that reassures that a person can and does do that. "

One of my favorite first date activities would be something like mini-golfing or bowling, because they are fun, do not have to be too serious, and can be a little competitive. Of course, the perfect date would have some sort of food element, because who does not love food? I am not really a ""Netflix and chill"" kind of person (although I do really like Netflix). I like things that are a little more active and exciting. Of course, there is the stereotypical fair/carnival date, or one at some sort of sporting event, and even though they are a little clich?, I do not mind the idea of them because they are both something that is more interesting than just watching a movie. In hindsight though, the perfect date would be something that was fun and energetic, and also was not that serious. As far as the ideal romantic partner goes, I am not too sure about that either (again, I am not that picky). I am single right now and do not really have anyone I am interested in, so I am not too sure about who/what I am looking for. Physically, I like guys that are tall, and I usually like guys with dark hair, although it's not a hard and fast rule. Personality wise, I am a little more particular. Probably the most important thing is that my ideal romantic partner would have to be honest and loyal, because my ideal date would be with a serious romantic partner, and I would not consider a romantic partner without those two qualities. In addition to that, the ideal romantic partner would have to be humorous, because a big part of being able to laugh and have fun on a date is being with someone who is funny. Another important thing is that it would not be an ideal date if the person who I was with was not polite and respectful. Usually, these are two qualities that you assume most people have, but in order to have the most ideal date possible with the most ideal romantic partner, these are two qualities the partner would have to have. Really, my ideal romantic partner for a perfect date would just be someone who was trustworthy and polite, but was also able to have fun and not be too serious."

He must care about other people. He must be nice to me. I want a man who wants a family (and supports my dream to adopt and foster children and not have biological children) and to help save the world. He would have to balance out my bold personality, while still not dealing with my shit. He would be patient with me and stand up for me and protect me, as I would do the same for him. The perfect date to me is getting dressed nice,but not too fancy, maybe khakis and a shirt for him and a flowy dress for me. We would go to the farmers market and then go get brunch. After eating pancakes and eggs, we would go to a coffee shop and walk around downtown and people watch. He would hold my hand and kiss my forehead and bring a sense of safety to my life. It would be amazing, but not realistic, to then lay out on the beach when it is hot but breezy and just hang out. Being naked would be awesome, but not necessarily for the sexual aspect of it. Rather I think i would enjoy the vulnerability of it.(I probably will regret this when my pale ass gets sunburnt or my nipples start burning) Laying out and watching the waves would be awesome. We could go for a quick swim (although I can barely swim) or take a boat ride.Then we could take a quick nap because 1.) I love naps  2.) It feels great to wake up next to the person you loveand 3.) who has the energy to stay awake all day while doing cool stuff? Not me.  Then we would get ready and change into something that makes people want to be us. Later we could go get drinks and dance at the dock when we are tipsy and purely happy with one another. Then go get Mexican food and just enjoy each others company and laugh too loud. Then we would go back home and have really good sex. And I understand that you said date and I described a day but I think really great dates aren't really about the fanciness but rather about the connection and the time you spend and that could last all day. After sex we would cuddle up and each read our books until we get tired. He would then give me a massage and then he would scratch my back until I fell asleep.

Oddly enough, I only like talking to people that I am comfortable with, so I would more than likely be trying to keep myself from launching into a tangent over something random and off-topic. My partner would either be fine with staying quiet, or would be just as talkative as I am. Personally, I would rather they be the latter. It is nice to have someone who can counter my secretly chatty personality with one of their own.I would also like to go out and do something that does not involve interacting with a lot of people, so a trip to a bookstore or a hike would also be preferable. My interest in books would lead to conversations about their favorite works and would be an enjoyable, albeit expensive, bonding experience. A hike would let us talk to each other about trivial things such as the weather or what our favorite season is. We could also, towards the end of the hike or in the middle, talk about what we want in the future: Of our hopes and fears, or about our past joys and pains. It would be a chance to get to know who we are as people, and build trust between us.There are some things that I would like to do that involve larger crowds. Sometime, I would like to see a concert with someone, and that would be a perfect date for me. It would give us chances to figure out the other's taste in music, and what they like and do not like about certain genres. I also like to see movies, which is probably a clich? and one that I gleefully buy into. We could share laughs in comedies, talk about how amazing that action movie was, cry together over touching moments in dramas, and hold each other through a horror movie.I enjoy the type of old fashioned dates that allow people to grow together and learn more about their partners and themselves. Dates such as seeing movies, having dinner, and simply indulging in each other's company have a special appeal to me. I am a romantic person, and I would like to have someone to hold and hold me, to know my likes and dislikes and surprising me with loving actions. I like someone who is proud of who they are, and who are unafraid to be themselves in front of me. I also like people who can challenge me intellectually and enrich my life through literature, art, and music."

I don't want him to spend a ton of money on me but I want it to be something that required planning and not just a trip to the movies. While anything can be fun if you're with the right person, my perfect date would not be the movies. I think something that would be really fun is doing something silly like mini golfing and then going on a walk or something and watching the sunset or something cheesy.

I would fly us out on a Monday and come back about ten days later. I would like us to stay at a resort and our room would be gorgeous with an amazing view. I'd want rose petals on the bed and I'd want a huge bathroom. I'd also want a balcony in the suite. I'd want to look out onto the ocean.In the mornings I'd want to drink mimosas on the balcony and have room service delivered. During the days I'd want to lay out on the beach, ride jet skis, tour the area, take a boat ride. I'd like to go exploring in the tropical forests. I'd like to take a private boat to a private island to swim with the dolphins and other sea creatures. I'd want to get pictures with animals we were able to see. The evenings is where I'd like it to really be romantic. I'd like to have nice dinners and of course be dressed appropriately for the occasion. I want to go to the bars and drink with my boyfriend and dance. I just want to have a good time. I'd want to use the pool and hot tub at the resort. I'd like to use those when no one else is using them. I'd want to get drinks for the outdoor bar and maybe even a snack or two. I'd want a day where we rent a car so that we are able to drive around the country on our own and see what there is. It would be a day that me and my boyfriend could focus on just each other and have a nice road trip. Throughout this trip I'd want my boyfriend to be so romantic. I'd want him to hold my hand and kiss me unexpectedly. This would help to make our relationship even stronger than it is at the moment. On this trip I'd like for me and my boyfriend to meet a lot of people that we would always remember. I'd like to even maybe stay in touch with some of them.I want this trip to be a big experience that me and him will always look back on. I want it to be a vacation that is hard to beat. One of the days on this vacation I'd want to go on a huge shopping spree. I'd buy so much that I would have to ship it back separately. I'd want to buy my boyfriend everything he wanted and I know he would do the same for me. I want to be shown all the nicest stores. I'd be a total tourist on this day."

I would shower and brush my hair and teeth, change into comfortable clothes, and eat breakfast while waiting for him to come pick me up.The whole date would be a planned surprise that I already figured out , he would come to my house with flowers, (irises, those are my favorite) and tell me we were going to get ice cream. As I hope into the car I realize that there is a basket on the floor board and blankets and pillows filling the bed of the truck. We would drive down a long winding background listen and singing to music and laughing at each other.The day would be a chilly fall day, the kind of day perfect for cuddling with a loved one. The sun would be setting, creating an amazing work of art in the sky.Finally when we find a place to picnic we would be out by a river/pond/lake. We would have a picnic with vegan pizza, sushi, peanut butter and jelly, sparkling grape juice, and homemade chocolate chip cookies. Obviously he wouldn't make the cookies his mom who adores me would make them, because he and she knows I love them. His favorite bands or artists would be playing like Tom Petty, Neil Young, or Led Zeppelin would be playing softly in the background as we sit and admire the beautiful space around us. We would tell each other about our days and crack jokes and laugh with each other. I would sit there with his arm around me, my head resting on his shoulder, his chin on the top of my head feeling the vibrations of him singing softly along to the songs being played. The trees would be buzzing with the noise of insects and animals as the sky started to be filled with the strobe lighting of fire flies.Then after we are done eating would would climb into the bed of his truck with blankets and pillows all in the bed and hold each other while watching the stars. Holding on to each other like we wouldn't see tomorrow. As we fall asleep to the humming of the wilderness and the light from the beautiful night sky. Then waking up in the morning we would wake up in each others arms and we would drive home make a huge breakfast and stay in for the rest of the day watching the office or American horror story while laying on the couch, ending our day perfectly "

I would love to be with someone that is from a small town with country roots but doesn't mind being in a city either. I want to be able to engage in things like rodeos, back roading, and country concerts with my partner, but I also want to be able to go out to the clubs together and have fun in the presence of city life and with many of our friends. I am looking for a financially stable guy as well as someone who is caring and trusting of me and our relationship. Although finances is not a deciding factor, I would love to have someone that I knew would be able to support himself or us together if needed. If I was able to find this guy the perfect date would start out by going to a nice dinner. I am not the type that needs a five star expensive and fancy dinner, but a place that we can enjoy together and be ourselves and still enjoy nice dinning with a relaxing atmosphere. After dinner I would love to go somewhere and play games and do recreational activites. I find that bringing out the inner child in someone is a great way to enjoy the presence of each other while still having fun. I would like to go somewhere that we could play mini golf, play arcade games, ride go karts and do fun competitive things together while still having fun. After enjoying plenty of time at a place where we could enjoy all these things, I would want to go to the grocery store and both pick out a drink and a snack that is our favorite. I think this is fun because it shows the other person a little bit about your self while having your favorite snack and maybe even sharing with each other! After getting snacks I would love to go put on comfy clothes and lay on the couch together and watch movies. One of my favorite down times is to be able to watch movies and be lazy, and it makes it even better to be able to do this in the presence of your idea romantic partner. Although I am a sucker for expensive, fun and cute dates, my perfect date would still consist of doing something fairly inexpensive while still having fun with each other. I feel that the perfect date doesn't really exist without the ideal person, making the question is there really a perfect date or is it the person your with making it fun and perfect. "

I would take her to dinner, a restaurant somewhere in town, We would go somewhere nice because its always good to make a good impression, we would eat dinner and then afterwards maybe go and get ice cream or go to a movie. Do something to kill some time, After that we could sit somewhere and talk for a little bit to learn about one another and then when its time to take her home drive her home and walk her to the door and kiss her before she goes inside. Another idea of  a perfect date would be just to hangout together and do something we both like to do, I'm an outdoorsman so i like to hunt or fish or shoot and we could always do something along those lines and spend the day together doing something we both enjoy and maybe just relax and then spend the afternoon sitting by a fire and enjoying the sunset or sitting by a lake or river somewhere and making some dinner for us to eat. Show the girl how much a gentleman you gotta be by always opening the door for her, and paying for  a meal or ice cream or a movie or whatever it may be. If its the first date then i would have to be respectful and not to try to rush anything or do anything to upset her, i would end the date with walking her home or driving, and then walking her to her doorsteps and kissing her goodnight, and just leaving it at that. I would not want to upset her by rushing into anything that she doesn't like. I feel like in a guys mind, the perfect date should be what they think the girl wants, not what the guy wants, so if the girl just wants to lay around and talk, get to know each other than that is what it should be, if the guy wants to just have sex then the girl probably won't like that and most likely won't lead to another date, the guy needs to think about what the girl might want.                                                                                                   "

Do you want the fantasy version that will probably never happen or a realistic version? Well I'm going to give you the more realistic version. I like to say when it comes to dating me I am an old fashion person. I like the little things and not really about the flashy things. Looks are just bonus I go for me of a personality when choosing a date. Something I would like on a date would be a picnic, like that kind of old fashion. Really expensive dinners and fancy places are nice every once in a while, but guys think to hard when trying to impress a girl. I would prefer to go on a picnic somewhere with open grass and a lake or pond near by, and actually sitting on the ground and enjoying nature rather than sitting at an actual picnic table. Of course if you would to go on a picnic and sit on the grass then we would have to have a large blanket to sit on and eat our food on. A perfect date would probably be the guy actually planning the whole thing, no matter what it was or how it was done I'd be slightly impressed if he planned it all by himself or mostly himself. This is a hard question for me because a lot of different things could be a perfect date, and there might be something out there that I would like even more than what I'm trying to describe but I don't know it yet. As long as there was effort and love put in to it more than likely it will be a perfect date or day. Even if something were to go wrong it could still be perfect like for an example if a bird stole our sandwich that we were suppose to eat that could be funny and make the picnic more memorable than it would of been. The perfect date really does depend on how things go, like what he says what he does or what he does not do. I would like to say that I have not really had a perfect date or anywhere near a perfect one so describing something that I would want for something like this is really hard. A perfect date would be that person and me and having a good time in general you really don't need much more than that. You need love, effort, and both of the two people together. If you are having a good time and he is having a good time and your both laughing and having fun then that is a perfect date."

I'm currently single and not really looking to be in a relationship, so I guess you could say I would be easily pleased with anything that a boy would want to do for me. I'm not really someone that needs extravagant gestures in a relationship, although every once in a while they can be fun. In college I would say a fun date would be something like having breakfast together, then spending the day outside like on some trails. I also really like to take road trips, so maybe a fun day of going on a quick trip and experiencing things in a new town and going out to dinner there, etc. That would be more of a big thing to do with someone. Concerts are one of my very favorite things, so I figure when I do get into a relationship I would like for him to take me to concerts and have that experience together. Little things just like a study date at a coffee shop or grabbing a quick bite to eat for lunch together are things that still sound very appealing to me since I am not in a serious phase of my life right now. I really like surprises that show how much a person cares about you, so I guess that would also be something I would enjoy. In high school once a boy surprised me for my birthday and told me to get ready for dinner, where he took me to my favorite place. So to this day I do still remember that just because it was so thoughtful. I would say meaningful things that like, that show the other person has paid attention to what you like and wants to make you happy, that's what would make a date ideal. It doesn't always have to be a grand gesture. I once had a boyfriend, who really sucked, and he always made me go fishing with him. I did, because I wanted to do what he wanted to do and make him happy. But at the end of the day we rarely did what I ever wanted to do, therefore there wasn't a good balance. I think that's what it's all about. If I really wanted to go to a concert, but maybe it wasn't my boyfriend's favorite artist, maybe he would still take me. And then later I would do something for him that I know he would appreciate, even if it's not my favorite thing. I really am open to doing anything he would want to, I like to try new things. I think I'm also at a very busy point in my life with school, work, and other priories, so I would probably just like to relax a lot of the time and do small things. I would be looking for someone that can understand my busy schedule and still make time to do those little things. "

I would begin by getting prepared. I would shower approximately two hours prior, as I have long hair and it takes a while to completely dry because I do not like or use hair dryers. After my shower I would put on deodorant. After I put on deodorant I decide what to wear. I would not want to go too casual or too dressy, so I would go with a happy medium such as khakis and a polo, or something of that variety. Right before I leave I would put on my nicest cologne, Guess by Marciano, and leave to pick her up. This is an unfortunate circumstance, however, as I have, for lack of a better term, a piece of shit for a car. But it is what is customary in our society so I have to live with it. The next part is arguably the most important. When I pick her up it is vital to make a good impression on her parents, specifically her father, so I would engage in clever conversation while she finishes getting ready. After I completely win over her father we leave to go to a restaurant. Not too nice, but nice enough. Restaurants are the ideal place to have a date, as it is the easiest way to notice the other persons little tendencies to see if they are the ideal mate or not. Things such as chewing with their mouth open, how they act toward the wait staff, and things such as that. I also test her occasionally. For example, I would purposefully not speak to see of she is capable of creating her own conversation. While the previous sentences were filled with a lot of more scientific sounding things, on a real note I would need to see if the other person is similar to me. As I have found, there can be no relationship with anyone, whether it be a romantic relationship, a friend relationship, or a family relationship, there cannot be a relationship without shared interests. No matter what anyone says, nobody can truly be satisfied with a relationship where you are too different from the other person. Anyways, I am a gentleman so after the restaurant, I would immediately take her back to her residence and reflect on whether or not I would wish to continue seeing the person."

The ideal date would be for my partner and I to have no awkward silence, feel comfortable around each other, and be able to just carry on a conversation for hours. This would be amazing because we would become closer and create memories by just being around each other. If I had to choose an ideal destination for a perfect date it would be a trip over seas to a destination that we both have never been to before. I would choose somewhere like Paris because it Is the city of love or England, Rome, Germany. These places would create a romantic setting for my partner and I and this would be fun and adventurous. One thing I would be most excited for would be exploring the older architecture or castles. This would be a beautiful site. One place that would be super cool to go to would be the Eiffel tower and have my significant other and I have a romantic candle lit dinner on the top of the Eiffel tower. In my in vision we would both be dressed to the nines in the finest attire. Then to make it even more special we would be both having a fancy French dinner. Then after dinner to top it off have him lean in and give me a passionate kiss while overlooking the city of love. This would be a dream date because we would be able to see new sites, try new food, and explore. Trying new things such as trying new food and exploring new places will allow us to learn new things about each other such as what places we liked to see and what new foods we liked or didn't like. This would be very romantic and my ideal of a fun date because we could create long lasting memories and we would be able to treasure them forever. Also on my ideal date I would love to capture the moment. So during the date we could take several pictures so later we could look back on that moment. Also the pictures we take we could make a scrapbook and have a book full of memories with pictures to look back on after the trip. Also going over seas would allow us to learn new things about each other and explore a side of the partner that we have not. This would over all be a dream date because we could capture the moment, explore new things, and create long lasting memories."

It would probably be a Friday night, after I have had a stressful week at work. I think that it would be sweet if he plans it all, based off of things we like to do. He tricks me and has me guess things I think the date may consist of, but none of my ideas are correct. So once he calls me, he tells me what to wear and what time that I need to be ready by. He tells me to dress up, so I wear a fancy outfit. This consists of a nice, long dress and heels. He will then come to our house and he is dressed in a nice suit and fancy outfit himself. He still does not give me any details of where we are going, so he just starts to drive. We arrive into a bigger city that is a little far away so we can have a nice mini road trip. We both like going on drives and being in the car together, so this is perfect. I would envision this town to be about an hour to an hour and thirty minutes away. 	Once we get to this town, we go to his favorite restaurant, that I have never been to, so he has to show me the best things to order. After we eat, we take a walk around the city. He knows I like aesthetically pleasing things and likes to take pictures, so we run into the city?s art museum. At the art museum, an Art Gala is going on. I get excited to see a lot of people there in fancy dresses and suits. He then tells me that we have tickets and are to attend the Gala as well. While here we take cute and artsy photos. We walk around the museum and admire the art. After the Gala, we get in the car and start to drive back home. Once we get near home, we pull over to our favorite spot and star gaze. This is my favorite thing to do, so we lay there and look at the stars. We end up staying in this spot looking at the stars and talking for a while. After we star gaze, we sit in the car and sing to some of our favorite songs and then we make it back home. By this time it is pretty late so we decide to go back home and watch a movie. We get ready for bed and then both snuggle in our bed and watch our favorite movie. He goes to the kitchen and brings up our favorite snacks. "

He would come and pick me up in his car and open the door for me. We would drive and have fun singing to a bunch of old throwback songs because that is always so fun to do. We would start the date by swimming in the ocean and just having fun at the beach. Then we would go change and meet back at the beach for a candlelit dinner. There would be a blanket set up with pillows. He would have our favorite foods with him in a little basket and we would sit there and eat and just talk about life. After we were done eating we would walk the shoreline or maybe even go into the water and just have fun at the beach. While we were walking the beach the sun would just start to set and we would sit there and watch it. After the beach he would drive us to a gelato or ice cream place and we would go and get ice cream. After that we would probably go to one of our apartments or houses and just hang out or watch a movie. After that I would thank him for the best date ever and he would leave. To go into more detail, I think it would be really cute if he has some of our favorite meals (mine would be potatoes and red meat) with some of our favorites drinks like sparkling grape juice or something like that. We would be open with each other and tell each other about our lives. I really think that it is important to talk to each other about certain topics during dates like where you see yourself in the future because you need to see if this relationship is worth pursuing. I think that at this point in our lives we need to think more about our relationships lasting after college and seeing if these relationships are worth the time and the effort. I think a part of my ideal date would be him saying that he really sees us working out and that he wants to continue down the path that we are going. I think that it is important for me to know exactly where I stand with him because I don?t want to be lead on or let down. I really think that openness is a big thing for me on my ideal date because I really want to know what I?m getting myself into and I want to know more about them. I think it?s important that we have deep conversations and not just talk about the surface level things. "

It would be hot but not too hot. It would be spontaneous, a spur of the moment kind of plan. We would pack some spare clothes, swimsuits, and towels, and head out. We would stop and grab some food to go, such as Subway my favorite fast food restaurant and then hit the road. We would go to some fun outdoor place not too far away, such as the lake. The entire car ride would be full of jamming out to all of the most random yet most perfect music. We would belt out anything from rap to old school Disney. The window would be down and we would just vibe to music and the car ride. We would both just simply be carefree and happy, enjoying each other and the day. Once we got to the lake we would head down to the dock and just sit down in the sunshine. We would eat the food we had brought, talk, and just sit there looking at the beautiful water. The sun would be shinning and we would both be getting a tan. Sooner rather than later on of us would push the other in, and it would be super funny. Then we would just swim and lay on the Lilly pad, soaking in the beautiful day. The most important part is that I want the person I was with to be someone that I could be genuinely myself around and they could be themselves around me. I want to be with someone who just loves me for me. It would be a dream day just to spend the entire day at the lake goofing off, swimming, laying out in the sun, and just genuinely enjoying the person I was with. There would be no tension or awkward moments. If there was a pass of silence the both of us would understand each other well enough to now that silence is okay, and just being there together with each other was enough. The day would seem to pass by in the blink of an eye, because I would be having such good of a time I would never stop and think about the time. It wouldn't just have to be the two of us on our ideal date. My family is really important to me, so I want a boyfriend I am secure enough in my relationship to know that it doesn't have to be just the two of us there to know that we are growing closer. My ideal date would have no pressure, it would be the kind of thing that whatever happens happens and I'd be okay as long as we are happy and having fun."

When it?s a good temperature out, not too hot and with a nice breeze. He would pick me up and stay for a while and talk to my family. I want to be with a guy who is close and comfortable with my family. Family is so important to me so finding someone that clicks with them would be ideal. Also someone that is comfortable with me. Someone that I could be myself around and he can be himself around me too. I want a boy who makes me feel happy for forgets about everything just for the few hours I am with him. A boy who will love me unconditionally, no matter my mood, how I look, what I am wearing. He shouldn?t care any of those things. He should just care about me and how much he cares about me. I want to be close with his family as well because well, we are going to be spending a lot of time together so we might as well be familiar with each others families too. I want a boy who will be silly with me and mess around with me but not to the point where he hurts my feelings. A boy who is religious and is willing to go to church with me even if he doesn?t have the same religion as me but is willing to do anything for me because he loves me unconditionally. After he picked me up, he would roll the windows down and blast country music. Country music is something that gets my mind off of everything just for a little while. The craziness of school, work, and other little things going on in life. As we made it to the beach, we would stop and go to cute little restaurant on the beach. Those are my favorites, you?re able to hear the waves crashing on shore and you?re eating with a view and the person you really like. I mean does it get any better than that? After that we would head down to the beach. Not too many people would be there, it?s relaxing when the beach is sort of empty. There we would lay out and tan, go on a walk, and hang out in the water. As we were walking into the water, one of us would eventually end up pushing the other one in the water. I love the beach, it?s such a relaxing place to be. All my worries seem to disappear when I am there. It would be even better if I was with someone who I really liked. We would stay at the beach until the sun set, after that we would grab dinner somewhere. He would drop me off back at my house and give me a kiss goodnight and tell me he had a bunch of fun."

However, I suppose I will have to settle for writing it out my cheesy, straight-from-hollywood type of date. 	First off, I don?t have the car I have now because I have traded it out for a more economical, environmentally friendly car that presents a better image of myself before I pick her up. After driving to her house, I grab the bouquet of flowers in the passenger seat and walk up to the door. She answers with a smile and is genuinely surprised as I hand over the flowers. She invites me in while she grabs a vase for the flowers. Soon after, we get back into the car and head off towards the town. Through the rest of the day, and eventually night, we wind up going to numerous places. We visit a bookstore, a restaurant, and end up in a park. 	The bookstore we go has the heavy smell of used books, the one I hope everyone is all too familiar with--I know I am. We peruse for a while looking through book after book. We share our favorite stories that we read while growing up and expose our most embarrassing secret, nerdy book obsessions. The bookstore has a cat that likes to mingle with the customers and we end up petting it for a while after looking. We end up in the corner with her head on my lap, a poetry book in each of our hands. Occasionally we would find one that is just too good to not share. After the book is read cover to cover, we place it back on the shelf, say a goodbye to the cat, and head out the door. 	The restaurant we head to is one where sushi is abundantly served because sushi is our favorite food. We order a few rolls and eat from each of them and share different kinds. Classical piano music is playing in the background and twinkle lights occasionally flash every so often. We have intellectual conversations about life and living and passions. We?re laughing together and feeding off of each other's energy and love. 	After wrapping up dinner, we head down the sidewalk and make our way to a local park. It?s Christmas time and the lights are hung up all around and light displays are all around us. We walk and talk and talk and continue to talk about anything and everything. There isn?t one point in the day were we run out of topics or words for each other. We end on top of a hill covered in snow, overlooking the park. As it begins to snow, we go in for a kiss. The End. "

The right person varies for each individual, but generally it should be someone that shares the same core values with you. While they should have many important similarities, they should also have differences that complement your qualities. For example, I am a strong introvert, so an extrovert would complement me and force me to come outside of my comfort zone a little bit. However, an ideal romantic partner for me does not have to be extroverted, they just have to be able to push me outside of my shell a little bit at a time. Furthermore, my faith is an essential quality in who I am, so I need a partner who is also grounded in their faith. Another important quality that I look for is intelligence. I need someone who I believe to be intelligent and am able to hold a quality conversation with. This ideal partner must also be incredibly kind and loyal as these are qualities that I value and believe will also benefit the relationship in the long run. While I have a few qualities that I view as necessary in a potential romantic partner, there are many other qualities that I highly respect and will increase how attracted I am towards someone else. I believe that a perfect date consists mainly of being with the right person because if you don't enjoy the company of the person that you are with, none of the rest of the date matters. A perfect date would consist of just wanting to spend time together and not have as much pressure as a grand date. This would mean spending time talking to each other and just enjoying each other's company over dinner or coffee or some other venue. Ideally, this would also be accompanied by something exciting such as a concert or event to extend the amount of time that you spend together. Ultimately, a very important aspect of a date is that conversation flows and is not forced or stressful. That conversation should also be meaningful and truthful and not simply full of meaningless jabber. A perfect date should be meaningful to both of the people involved and be something that they both like to do or that they like to do together. This way both can equally enjoy the date, and there is no pressure for either one to conform his or her interests with what the other enjoys. "

One idea that is rather cliche but would be totally awesome would be to go to New York City during Christmas time. First we would get all bundled up and dressed up and we would go eat at an upscale restaurant, but nothing too fancy. This would all start right as the sunset. We would joke around and just laugh and make memories throughout dinner. Next we would walk around New York City, looking at all of the Christmas trees and decorations. We'd take a pit-stop and go to a bakery or something along that effect and get hot chocolate, drink one inside while we warmed up and take one to go to stay warm. We would then go to the ice skating arena and ice skate to beautiful Christmas music. However, we probably wouldn't skate too long because I would get cold. Then we would get cinnamon roasted warm pecans while we continued to observe the beautiful decorations and take pictures, stopping into cute shoppes and buying stuff we liked, along with buying Christmas decor. When we finally have had enough of the cold we'll go back to wherever we're staying, (more than likely a hotel), put up a small Christmas tree and decorating it. While we were doing this we would be wearing some adorable pajamas, jamming out to Christmas music, and baking chocolate chip cookies. When all of that was said and done we would cuddle up with lots of blankets, milk and cookies and watch as many of my favorite classic Christmas movies before we fell asleep. Movies like: Elf, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, A Christmas Story, Home Alone, The Grinch, Miracle on 34th Street. We wouldn't watch all of them just as many as we could until we finally fell asleep. When the morning came we would make a cute breakfast, probably pancakes or french toast and watch more Christmas movies. The ideal romantic partner for this date would be my current boyfriend because I couldn't imagine doing it with anyone else. We would have so much fun, and we would both just be so happy. His warm big body would pair perfectly with the chilly winter New York weather. I hope one day we can actually make this trip and take this date, but for now it will remain a dream until it comes true."

I would come to her house to pick her up around five on a friday or saturday night. I'm wearing a nice pullover jacket with jeans and my boots. I walk up to her house and knock on the door. She opens the door. I first notice her long blondish brown hair flowing, then her blue eyes, and lips. She's wearing a long sleeve shirt and vest with jeans and nice pair of shoes. I walk her to my truck and open the door for her. Then we go to eat at her favorite restaurant. We sit and talk over an appetizer and drinks, and then we eat dinner. After we're done eating dinner I hand her a necklace she told me she'd been wanting. I help her put it on. I pay for dinner and then we're on our way to the next part of my perfect date. I would take her out on my farm  around seven o'clock and into the middle of a field where I already stacked wood for a fire. I back the truck up to where the tailgate of my truck is a few feet away from the stack of firewood. I then lay down blankets and pillows in the bed of my truck. Then i light the fire so we can stay warm on this fall night. It is around sixty degrees and there isn't a cloud in the sky. We then get into the bed of my truck and wait for the sun to go down. Finally the sun starts to go down and the stars start to come out on a clear evening to night, a bonfire in front of the tailgate, with dancing flames. There would be a natural comfortability between us, the ability to talk openly and honestly on all subjects, and the gift of shared laughter. The date itself could be anywhere as long as there is a natural comfortablity between us...is the quality of comfortablity together that means more then 'where' the date is. We would just lay there and talk about anything and everything. She would be in my arms and the blankets would be covering our bodies keeping us warm. Finally I would put out the fire and take her home anywhere from one to three in the morning. I would walk her up to her door. Staring into eachothers eyes it would feel like it was just us two in the world, we would not want this moment to end. Finally I would hug and kiss her goodnight and she would hug and kiss me goodnight back. I would not want to let go of her. But I finally do and she goes inside. That would be my perfect date."

I would want to spend a whole Friday around late August with my girlfriend. This way the next day would be for college football Saturday. I do love being outside though, so ideally my perfect date would take place at the lake. For this part of the date I would want there to me more than just us, maybe with a few of our close friends are with us too. But there is probably nothing I would love more than to go out all day and just do watersports on the lake with a female companion. I would hope she would be participating too, not just sitting on the boat being afraid of the water or getting her hair wet. Just go out and have fun. If she really wanted to win me over she could fish with me towards the end of the day. This is really pushing it to all be in one day but I think it would be fun to go to the driving range at Top of the Rock at night and shank some golf balls. I am not a good golfer but I think in general it is fun to wack some golf balls. I think it would be cool to just wander around with my girlfriend at Top of the Rock and just talk, chill, whatever. I would want to go out for some ice cream preferably at Braum's or Andy's to top off the day and then just go home, relax, and cuddle. Maybe watch a few episodes of the Office. Cuddling and watching the Office could be my dream date all together honestly. Ideally I would be playing video games around this time but it is a date and I realize she probably wouldn't like that. Obviously we would have eaten during the day, I would prefer Chipotle or Qdoba for dinner maybe a donut shop for breakfast. Can't go wrong with Chick Fil A for lunch, I know that is eating out three times in one day but this is ideally. Also after we leave the lake I would want to split up from being with our friends so that we can be alone. After all that I'm pretty sure we would both be tired so we could go to sleep, wake up the next day and I could watch college football gameday and she could stay with me or do her own thing. One big thing for me is that we don't have to be together all the time, I think that makes being together more meaningful and fun. And since we would be together all day on that Friday, absolutely NO school work or actual work to worry about."

Anything more seems a little excessive to me and not necessary. But considering that I already have the person I truly want to be with, it's almost entirely up to her and how she feels. She does like surprises though, so I'll also set up an area at our home that has lights and candles and music that we would slow dance to. After some time slow dancing, I would tell her the one story that she loved, the one how we met and how I felt about it. And after I say the line, ""You became my world,"" I would bend down on one knee and ask her to marry me. My ideal date with the person I love is the one where I will finally be able to truly show her how much she means to me, and how much I am willing to show her that it's true. Honestly, there would be nothing else more perfect than that, and there isn't anymore to that date that I would really want to add.

For the perfect date night, I would want my boyfriend to pick me up on a cool summer night in his red, lifted truck, wearing his cowboy boots with a pair of jeans. He would walk up to my door and come with my favorite flowers, which are white roses. He would shake my dad's hand, even though he knows him well and has shook his hand a thousand times. He would hug my mom and play with my brother, sister, cat and dog and we would leave for our night out. I would struggle getting into the truck because it is so high, and he would open my my door for me and help me up. I would be wearing my boots and a dress and he would take me in the middle of no where, preferably in a field far away from the city. We would lay in the back of his truck with blankets and pillows to make it soft, and have drinks and food. I would really want to watch the stars and the sky all night with him laying by my side. We have a certain constellation that we call ""ours"", so I would pray that we could see it very well that night and that there were minimal clouds. We would search for every shooting star we could find and each time use that wish for each other. We would talk about everything important to us and what we wanted out of our lives not only separately but together, too. The calmness and peace of being far away from civilization and only being with each other would be the best part about my perfect date. At the end of the night, we would go back to his house and hang out with all of his family and watch a movie until we decided that it was time for bed, and then we would go to sleep after an amazing date night. My favorite part of that date would not be the flowers, the food or the truck. My favorite part of the date would actually be the fact that he was respectful to my parents and family, that he was respectful to me, that he opened my door, and that he put the time, effort and thought into planning the date. My favorite parts of going on dates with my boyfriend are never the material things, but how he treats me and the love I see and feel that we have in our relationship. I will never get tired of going on dates with my best friend. "

It doesn't have to be a fancy dinner or an expensive outing. It could be a Netflix date in sweatpants for all I care, as long as I'm happy and they're happy, that's all that matters to me. Not every date has to be grandiose and special, sometimes something simple and low brow is preferred. Really I'd be satisfied with anything as long as my partner was happy. Obviously if at all possible I'd prefer to not spend too much money, but as long as it wasn't overboard, I wouldn't mind dropping some cash on a nice restaurant or a gift or something. Even my ideal partner isn't something I can be particularly specific about, I don't really have a ""type"". If they're cute, and they're nice, and they make me happy, they fit into my type. I've noticed I tend to have a thing for redheads or dyed hair, but other than that, there aren't really any specific traits I do or don't look for in a person. Just no obsessive clingyness, I will draw a line there. Not only is it really obnoxious, it's kinda unhealthy and I don't want to deal with it anymore than I have in the past. Okay I'm completely out of things to talk about and I still need to meet the stupid character limit so I'm just gonna ramble about the guy I'm obsessed with. He's really sweet and he's adorable and I just love talking to him and he makes me so happy and I wish I didn't go to school so far away from him because I want to see him all the time. He may live in Iowa but he's also the greatest thing to ever come out of Iowa except maybe Slipknot but I think he's better than Slipknot. Okay now I'm completely out of things to talk about and I still have 600 characters so I'm just gonna fill space because honestly this should have been based on a word requirement and not a character requirement. Actually neither would be preferable but a word requirement would be less stupid. It turns what could be simple answers into long winded fluffy messes. Kinda like essays. I understand what the intention was but it just drags on way longer than it needs to. Like I'm less than a hundred and fifty characters away from being able to submit this, I stopped talking about my date twenty minutes ago, and I've resorted to spelling out numbers in order to fill up space.

I've known him for a very long time but I still feel that spark every time I see him and this date is no exception. We met through my brother right after I got out of college and dated a while before he proposed after winning the World Series. My husband plays MLB baseball on the Kansas City Royals and he surprised me during his time off to show me a perfect night. He's a pitcher and had a couple games off before he had to go back. I usually go to the games being how I live in Kansas City during the season. But I had been living in our house in Arkansas while he was playing some postseason ball and practicing a lot. He first ordered Mexican food (Steven special) from my favorite restaurant, Mojitos. He got extra chips and salsa because he knows I can eat those all night. We sit in bed and watch Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 together laughing every so often. We can both quote it by heart. We even had pillows on our bed that say ""After all this time"" and ""Always."" He then brings in some strawberry ice cream which extra strawberry chunks. We eat the whole pint of ice cream very quickly. After that he says he has one more surprise for me. He takes me out to his truck and we drive out into a pastor, windows down, and the country music is blaring. We park the car up on the mountain overlooking the city. He then pulls out a blanket and we get in the truck bed. We stare at the stars for hours while he sings ""Yours"" by Russell Dickerson and ""Die a happy man"" by Thomas Rhett to me. He reassures me that he will always love me and that I'm the girl he's always dreamed of. We talk about how we met and how he knew right away that God had put me in his life for a reason. We drive back to the house and hop back into bed. We talk until we fall asleep in each others arm and wake up to the sound of Hedwig's theme song in the back because we forgot to turn the TV off. In the morning, we get up and he has a fresh pot of coffee brewing. We sit out on the porch listening to country music and talking about the next game. He then packs up and leaves to head on the road with playoffs coming up soon. I give him a kiss goodbye and thank him for the perfect night. That is my idea of a perfect date with my ideal romantic partner.  "

We would go skiing and ice skating during the day and at night just sit around a huge fire in our cabin. We could watch movies all night and just really enjoy time of relaxation together. My ideal romantic partner would probably be a girl that is about 5'10 with long brown curly hair. She would have huge brown eyes and be tan.So first off we would get up early and get all our skiing stuff together. We would both get ready and then go up the slope together. I would let her go first because she would be better than me. So she would go and make it all the way down the slope with ease and then she would yell for me to come down. I would try my best but I would wipe out twice before I actually made it all the way down the hill. We would do this for a while until it was a little after lunch time. We would go into a small town and eat at the local diner and meet some of the locals that lived there. They would tell us all about the history of the town and all the places that we should go before we leave. We would have our lunch and then tell all the locals goodbye. After lunch we would go find a ice skating rink. She would be very timid to go because she has never been before and is afraid that she would not be able to do it at all. I would tell her that I'll hold on to her and that it would be really fun. So I finally convince her to go and she absolutely loved it. We definetely fell quite a bit, but we both had a blast doing it. We skated for about three hours and by then we were both very tired. We decided we would go take showers and get ready at the cabin to go out to dinner. It was about 6 o'clock at this point and we were heading to a restaurant the locals told us we just had to go too. So we show up to this place and eat a delightful meal. We are both stuffed by the end of the meal and decide that it is time to just go back to the cabin and relax. So we payed our bill and headed back.When we got back to the cabin we decided to watch some movies. The first movie we watched was her choice, so it was more of a girly movie but still pretty good. The next movie we watched was my choice and I wanted to watch a horror movies because those are my favorite. So we turned on a horror movie and it turns out that she gets really scared during horror movies so we decide to turn it off and go to bed. We finally got to bed around 11 o'clock and just talk about how great our day had been. We decide that this was the best date either of us had ever been on and would always be the best."

Breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day, and who doesn?t like to eat at Denny?s?  I would get the chocolate chip pancakes, hash browns, bacon, and a smoothie.  And what would make it even more perfect, would be that he pays for it all.  The next part to my perfect day would be to go pick apples at an orchard.  I would want to do this in the morning because if you go later in the day, then it could be really hot, and I know some people, like me, don?t like it when it?s too hot outside.  After picking all the apples we would go into the little convenience store and look at all the things that you can buy there.  I would also get something from their bakery because the food from bakery?s where you can pick fruit fresh is always amazing.  Again, what would make it even more better is him paying for the apples and the bakery items. After we finish checking out, we would go out to lunch at Olive Garden.  There I would get a small house salad, breadsticks, and cheese ravioli.  We would take our time eating and getting to talk to each other and relax from picking and carrying around all the apples. Again, what would make it great would be that he pays for lunch. After going to Olive Garden, we would go to the St. Louis Botanical Garden.  At the garden, we would go to every single place you can.  We would also take a lot of pictures too.  Some of the pictures would be of us, and some of them would be of the plants I think are really pretty.  We would take all these pictures on a really nice camera, so that we would know for sure the quality is good. After going to the garden, we would take out camera to go get all of the pictures from the day printed out.  We would also buy a cute photo album to keep them all in so that they are easy to view and are kept safe.  After getting all the pictures printed and in the album, we would then go out to dinner at Texas Roadhouse.  At Texas Roadhouse we would get the two for $20 meal.  He would get the BBQ chicken and I would get the sirloin steak medium rare.  We would also each get one of the sides.  He would get the fries and I would get a loaded backed potato.  How we would pay for the dinner is with a gift card that a friend had given us because they know how much we love Texas Roadhouse.After dinner, we would go back to either my house or his house and we would watch Grey?s Anatomy until we got too tired to stay up anymore.

Most people enjoy going to a movie and going out to a nice romantic dinner date and making their date spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on you, but in reality, that does not happen a lot, at least for me it does not. My ideal perfect date would be going to dinner at a nice restaurant, getting to know my romantic partner, and being able to enjoy myself. Another big aspect is being able to be compatible with my date. Going out to dinner is nice because, everyone loves food. Who doesn't? I love getting dressed up and going on a nice date. Another huge aspect of the date is being able to enjoy myself. I do not want to have to think about any of my insecurities and I do not want my date to think about any of his either. I want both of us to be able to enjoy ourselves and have a good time. I want to be able to make jokes and laugh, while also getting to know each other. I want both of us to feel free to ask questions about our families and not feel awkward or uncomfortable about it. I just want for myself and my date to be able to be ourselves. One of the biggest aspect of my perfect date is getting to know my romantic partner. I think this is the most important part of the date. I just want to be able to actually get to know my date and I want him to get to know me as well. Personally, I do not think it matters how much my date spends on me. He could spend hundreds of dollars or he could spend nothing at all. Just as long as we both enjoyed ourselves and had a great time, that is what really matters. For example, I am from a very small town in Missouri where we did not have a lot to do. Most guys would take you on a date at the Taco Bell and then he would drive you around in his pickup truck until about three in the morning. To everyone around my town, that was the ideal perfect date. Even though it does not sound like much, it was still really enjoyable to just to get to know the person and just talk about nothing. Lastly, my romantic partner and I have to be somewhat compatible with each other. I do not want someone who makes me feel uncomfortable and someone who does not like to joke around. I want to feel a connection with my romantic partner, especially on a date. Having compatibility with my romantic partner will kind of make or break the date. You want someone who is like yourself, but not too much like yourself. My perfect ideal date would just be getting to know someone whether it be at a dinner table, or in a pickup truck, or just sitting on the couch. To me it does not really matter where, just as long as we both enjoy each other's company and have fun!"

After she agrees to a date, agree on a time to pick her up and going home to get ready myself. After getting ready and getting all fixed up, showing up to her house to pick her up with some flowers in the car sitting in her seat with a nice note that might say ""You look beautiful"" or ""Thankful for you"" on it to see a smile from her since that's your job in the first place, to make her smile. When she finally gets in the car holding her hand as we both go back and fourth as to where you want to eat only to end up deciding myself because she was too stubborn to pick a place or getting the typical ""I don't care"". Finally deciding on a nice steak house dinner or possibly even an Olive Garden dinner for two with a candle between us. After enjoying our meal then taking her out to her the get her favorite treat, all the way across town, Pineapple Whip. Then after going to play mini golf, or maybe even a movie. After enjoying our night out we stop by somewhere and get a bottle of her favorite wine and make our way back home to get into comfortable clothes and sit together on the couch, crack the bottle of wine and watch Netflix or an undesired chick flick until our eyes are heavy and we finally decide it's time to go to bed. Walking to the bedroom to go to bed and realizing the sheets are everywhere and the beds a mess, while she is in the bathroom, I fix the bed, make the sheets, and put away any clothes that might be scattered all over due to her trying on many different outfits before our date and all the random belongings that always cumulate on her bed throughout her busy day of work, school and extracurricular activities she has day after day. I realize everything is a mess and she would only appreciate that I am taking a few extra minutes to pick everything up and clean the room up before she gets in there, because it's all about the little things that make a person more appreciative of you. Shortly after she finally makes her way to the room and we lay in bed talking about all the plans we have the next day or simply talking about the future until we doze off. "

I worship the ground she stands on and she knows this. I've done something similar once where I wanted the girl I was with to feel valued, so I took her to her favorite restaurant, her favorite store, bought her what ever she wanted. I didn't do this because she was materialistic, if she was I wouldn't have been with her, but I did this because it was about her. I spent hundreds of dollars in a single day for a single person, because to me money wasn't important, she was everything that day. That to me is the perfect date. If I had the entire day I would make her breakfast, do everything throughout the day for her, take her somewhere she loves and let her know the love I have for her. It doesn't have to be extravagant but it's for her.If I had to pick another ""date"" that I would cherish is if we didn't do anything. Nothing at all, maybe watch some movies, read a book, and enjoy ourselves. No matter what the perfect date is always the one where she enjoys herself the most. Making the girl I'm with happy makes me happy. The never ending circle of happiness works well for me because it allows me to make myself happy by making my partner happy.Being able to be silly and laugh with each other is a good sign the date is going well. I've gone star watching in the middle of a field to make her happy, I've bought her books off the whim because she thought one was interesting, I've even given a back massage because she was stressed. The ideal date is about her happiness and ""date"" to me is whenever i'm fulfilling that goal.My perfect date is a date full of happiness, the contents of the date aren't of importance so much as the things that we feel. That euphoric feeling of love, happiness, and anticipation of the next thing is addicting to me. For the perfect date to happen all that needs to happen is that feeling, with out it then the perfect date doesn't happen. If I were to plan the most romantic and elaborate date, we both could hate it and that's now the most expensive worst date in the world. I've been on a date like that, sure it was a nice enough date I guess but I didn't enjoy it neither did the girl I was with and neither of us wanted to do it again. "

If there could be a perfect date, it would obviously have to be with a perfect girl; which could definitely take sometime trying to find. Nonetheless, once you find someone like that, the perfect date is finally possible. I'd say the date would start off picking up my romantic partner and taking them somewhere meaningful. This doesn't have to be expensive or far away, but a place that you both enjoy. For me, that would be either in the woods or simply on the beach. In my opinion, these are two of the most peaceful places in the world. This girls gonna have to find a love for fishing and riding four wheelers because this is most likely how the date would start. Once done with that, I'd be sure to take her somewhere nice for lunch, something fancy. Now, after getting some extremely good food, we'd go to just chill out and possibly get a movie. Naps also hold a special place in my heart, and honestly make me feel better. Now if possible, we'd hit a workout together. Nothing is more attractive than a girl who is willing to better herself and become healthier. After killing a workout, we'd go back home and I'd most likely make a great dinner. After whipping up an absolute monster meal, we'd just hangout on the beach and relax, having absolutely no worries, and just simply talking about life. These are the best conversations and really lead to you knowing the other person better. In all, I could really careless how fancy the date is. As long as it's quality time with someone you enjoy, that's all that really matters. All the best dates I've ever had have been extremely simple and elegant. If possible though, going to play with puppies would also be a great thing to do. I don't know a single person who doesn't love puppies, unless they're allergic which would be a tragedy. They always bring smiles, and if your girl is smiling, you're probably doing a good job, thus having a very good/productive date. Hence ending your perfect romantic date. In life, every person's perfect date is different; so to tell what your romantic partner likes, might be a little different, so try incorporating those things, to get the best of both worlds! Thank you for listening, and thank you for your time, regarding the perfect date with a romantic partner. "

The first one would be a whole day full of different activities.  It would start off with us going to Eckert?s Country Store & Farm or another pumpkin patch/apple orchard.  We would pick apples and take cute pictures in the orchard.  Then we would explore the rest of the farm and get desserts to take home.  After the orchard, we would go get lunch at Mom?s Deli and sit outside. I would get a Charlie?s Special, a Fitz?s root beer, and a bag of Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips, and he would get whatever he wanted.  Then, we would go to the zoo, see all of the animals, go to the sea lion show, and ride the train.  After the zoo, we would go get dinner at Texas Roadhouse.  We would get a Bloomin? Onion as an appetizer, but for my entr?e, I would get an eight ounce sirloin and steak fries.  Then, we would go see a couple of movies at the drive-in.  After that, we would go get ice cream at Dairy Queen and then he would take me home.  My other idea of a perfect date involves little to no effort on either of our parts.  It would just consist of my significant other and me laying in bed all day and watching movies.  Not just any movies, though, I would want to watch my favorite and his favorite movies.  We would have a marathon and only get up to switch movies or get more snacks.	A date would not be perfect if I was not with my ideal partner.  My ideal partner would be a guy who is funny, sensitive, and does not mind the fact that I can be a little weird.  Also, he has to be good at cuddling and giving hugs, and he has to be able to pick me up.  If he does not have good sense of humor, taste in music, or does not appreciate good films, then I do not think he would be the guy for me. Obviously, most people would say that their ideal man is someone who has a great body, is cute, and is someone you can have fun with, but that is not really important to me.  I definitely want someone I can have a good time with, but if all they are ever doing is partying, I am not going to want to be with them. It would be nice if the guy was super attractive, but I honestly do not care what a guy looks like as long as they are a good person and they make me happy. "

A perfect date for me is going out and doing something active such as mini golf. Also for it just to be easy and not require much effort to keep the conversation going. Dinner is always good as well. I don't like group dates as much because there's less time focussing on you guys. Allows for outside distractions, especially during first dates. If it's with someone you've known for a long time and have been dating for awhile then it's no big deal for there to be a double date. But at least for the first date, it should be alone to really get to know each other. There shouldn't be too much stress on trying to keep the conversation going, it should just flow for the most part. If you're trying too hard to think of what you're going to say next, then you aren't really paying attention to what the other person is saying and that's not promoting the relationship. Everything should just come naturally. I prefer to go out and do something active such as mini golf rather than a movie because in a movie there's not much talking. my last first date, there was a fall fun festival in town so there were a lot of booths and rides and what not. That was a lot of fun because it allows you the freedom of walking around and not being confined to a booth in a restaurant. Afterwards we went and got ice cream because who doesn't love ice-cream. You just kind of have to judge it on how the date is going. if it's going well then yea you leave happy, but if not then no it wasn't a good time. this helps with if you're going to continue trying to go on dates with this girl or not.

A perfect date could range from a lot of different things for me because I believe that I enjoy s lot of things. If I had to envision one perfect date though It would go something like this. We would start at my house around 4 o'clock and just chill and lay around for a little maybe watch a little tv or just take a nap. Then we would precede to get food. Now this step is very complicated because picking the perfect place can be a hard task . If I had to chose one place to eat it would probably be Buffalo Wild Wings. We would head out around 5 and get to the restaurant around 5:30 as soon as we got there I would order a beer and then order a bunch of hot boneless wings and my date would order the same. After eating all the wings we would get some dessert. Either dessert nachos or chocolate cake and we would share it. After my date would pay the tab for me because that would be perfect. After would would go back to the house and chill because we would definetly need to let the food settle. At around 715 we would get ready to go to a saint louis blues hockey game. We would drive to the stadium blasting music and having fun. Once we got to the stadium we would get the closest spot possible for free. We would cproceed to walk to the stadium with out VIP tickets and go in through the back way to meet the players one and one and get autographs from every player and get my very own personal jersey and hockey stick from the coach. Then we would take our on the rink seats watching the game close up during the game the blues would rout the blackhawks 10 to 0. At halftime they would bring me on the ice to shoot for some money and I would win the money handily. At the end of the game we would go for ice cream at silkys and I would get an Oreo concrete. After ice cream we would proceed to my house to watch movies and relax the rest of the date and I would take my date home after a wonderful, awesome date. This would be a fantastic date because first of all I love sports and food. I also love the blues and meeting the players would be a dream come true. Being on the ice and winning money would just be an added bonus. Another thing I love is to be lazy and relax so just chilling and watching movies at the end of the night would top of the date in a perfect way"

He would bring me flowers and I would introduce him to my family. I would also like to be able to get dressed up in a nice outfit, preferably a fancy dress, because I have never been on a date like that before. I would like to have the car door opened for me because that would be very romantic. I think it is nice for a guy to do that every once in awhile. I do not feel like men should do that for women all the time, as we can be independent, but it is nice. He would then drive us to the restaurant that we had agreed to go to when we set the date. He would help me out of the car and we would walk in my hand on his arm. I would like to go to a fancy dinner and be able to dress up. I imagine the restaurant is dimly lit and having large chandeliers, and vintage tables with small decorations all around. We would set reservations so we would be escorted right to our table.  The waiter would offer us wine and take our order. My date would be wearing nice pants and a dress shirt along with a jacket. He would pull out my chair and help me it down. We would sit and talk for hours about all sorts of things, like what we did as kids and what we love doing. I also love stories so I would have him tell me stories from his childhood and I would also tell him stories about me. We would talk about our goals and ambitions, but also talk about our families and what they are like.  After we were done we would fight over the check and then we would walk around the streets window shopping. We would learn about each other's tastes and maybe walk into a couple of stores. Then when It was getting late we would walk back to his car and he would drive me back to my place. He would walk me up to the front steps and slowly he would kiss me good night. That would be one of my ideal dates. I feel as though many people do not go on those kinds of dates anyone and I feel as though they should. This new generation is all about staying in or just doing things with friends. What happened to pick a girl up at her front door and taking her somewhere just the two of you?  I feel as though I am a hopeless romantic, but I feel as though this generation will lead to more breakups if people do not take the time to get to know each other properly."

First I would fly to him in Florida and he would pick me up from the airport and take me to the beach where he rented a hotel room. The first day we would get a hotel room and spend the day at the beach tanning and playing in the water and building sand castles while we sip on some drinks. We would rent jet skis and ride around for an hour until we got tired. Then we would go get dinner and drinks and talk about how college is going while a band plays and there are people all around.  After dinner we would walk on the beach at night alone and look at the stars.  We would look over the ocean and hear the waves and feel the salty air and talk about how big the world is.  We would chase sand crabs and try to catch them with our hands.  Then we would go home and watch a movie.  The next day we would wake up and drive to Orlando and spend the day chilling at his house and watching Netflix. The third day we would go to Magic Kingdom in Disney World.  We would spend all day there and stay for the fireworks over the Cinderella castle.  At the end of the night we would go home together and sleep all night.  The next day we would hang out with his family and swim in his pool with his mom and little sister.  We would spend all day together and then go out to dinner at night and get dressed up and eat sushi and get ice cream. The next day we would go to universal studios and ride all the rides.  We would eat gyros and go to harry potter world and get butter beer.  We would ride the fun rides as many times as we could until we were tired.  We would eat at Margaritaville on the board walk then run to the car in the pouring rain.  On the way home we would sing songs in the car loudly.  When we get home we would be so tired we would fall asleep as soon as we laid down.  The next couple days we would spend in downtown Orlando seeing the city and swimming in his pool.  We would play games with his family and watch movies.  Me and my boyfriend would then drive back home to Missouri together.  On the way home we would talk in the car and sing songs and have a good time.  We would drive all day and night to get home because it is a thirteen hour drive home.  We would have had the best week ever in Florida and spent time together with his family and bonding.

We have been together for a really long time and we have gone on a lot of dates together, so it is honestly kind of hard to think of the ideal perfect date! I think I would want to choose something that we both really genuinely love to do. The first few things that come to my mind are sports, music, and food. In my opinion I think that it would be so much fun to get tickets to either a concert or some professional sporting event and make a whole day out of it. I would make sure it would be the perfect date by spending the money on really close up seats because you're going to want a good view of the event. If I was going to this event in a big city we would spend all day exploring around the city and finding cool places to go to, or maybe go do some shopping. I think that it would be fun to then go to a fancy dinner that night right before the concert or game. I wouldn't care if we were dressed up or not because I mean if we are at a baseball or football game you don't dress up, so for me that makes it more fun! I'm not sure which concert I would choose because Parker loves country music and it is starting to grow on me so I would most likely choose Sam Hunt or Thomas Rhett. If I would choose another concert we would both agree on going to either Post Malone or Kendrick Lamar. If it was a sporting event I would choose to go to a Cub's vs. Cardinal's baseball game or an NFL game. We would have so much fun at any of those events because we both love going to concerts, I love the Cub's and he loves the Cardinal's, and we both love football. After the concert or sporting event I would want to go get frozen yogurt from a place like Orange Leaf because it is so good. Then we would go find something cute around town to go do and be adventurous because who wouldn't love that? I would then want to stay where we are at for the night and leave the next morning. Going to a concert or a professional sporting event with your ideal romantic partner would be one of the greatest things ever! To me, doing anything along the lines of everything I explained would be a perfect date. "

The he would come to my house to pick me up and not only come to pick me up but come up to my door to greet my parents and I. We would probably talk to my parents for a little bit since my parents need to approve of me being with this partner because I am very close with my parents so I am not going to date someone they do not like since they usually know what is best for me. So he would come in and we would sit around the living room catching up from the last time he saw them. We would then leave and ride to dinner, getting sushi since if he was my partner he would know it was my favorite. At dinner we would sit across from each other and talk and laugh just completely being distracted by each other with no need for cell phones since we would be so deeply in love. Even though he knows I hate it when he pays for things, he beats me too the server when I try to pay. Once again, he never fails to amaze me. Then after dinner we would go get ice cream since he knows it is my favorite dessert. We would go to Fritz's of course since it is my favorite place in St. Louis. He would order me a Carmel and Oreo concrete and then get one for himself. He tried to pay once again, but luckily I beat him this time. We would then sit outside enjoying the ice cream while the sun begins to set. He's so thoughtful when planning these dates, he knows the sunset is one of my favorite sights to just stare in awe at. While we are eating the ice cream and enjoying the sunset we would be laughing and enjoying each others presence once again. After this we would venture out to a drive in movie theatre. Now, these theaters are about an hour away from where we live so we would have a full hour to blast music as loud as we can singing and laughing with each other as loud as we can. This is one of our favorite things to do since hey, who doesn't enjoy belting their heart out to their favorites tunes with their best friend? Once we pull into the drive in theatre we would pull the car into a spot and set up the bed of the truck for us to lay on comfortably. This means countless pillows, blankets, and snacks or candy for us to enjoy the movie with. Laying in the back of his truck with cozy blankets and pillows everywhere is where you would find us. I would get to lay on his chest while having a view of the stars and my best friend right next to me all in one. We would then enjoy the movie, holding each others hands and laying close with each others presence-- having not a worry in the world. Hey, he might even end the movie with a romantic kiss. "

I would enjoy going for dinner of sushi or Italian food and talking for at least an hour, if not more. I would like to take this time to get to know someone in greater depth. Assuming this is a first date set up amongst acquaintances, I feel that somewhere not too fancy is a good way to really start to get to know a person and how they feel about certain things. I would not want all of this conversation to be base level, though. I would of course want to get to know basic things about them like what their goals are for the future, where they work, a little about their family, their hobbies, pets, etc. but I would want to have some deep conversation too. I have always found base-level conversation to be very awkward. This is because once a baseline conversation ends, it ends abruptly and with little satisfactory resolution. If this was all the conversation was, I feel like it would make for a poor date. During this time period, I would want to talk about something interesting and meaningful to a person because I like seeing people feel passionate about things. I feel that seeing them speak about something they really like or care about is a good way to see who someone really is as a person. This is also why I do not like small talk conversations. When you are talking to a person who has real fire for something, a conversation can continue for hours. It makes you more vulnerable and human to talk about something that is deeply cared for, rather than something basic. After eating, I would probably want to go see a movie with them. We would talk about what we wanted to see and pick it together so that the experience is worthwhile for both of us (because movies are way too expensive to see something you do not want to see). This is not necessarily an important part, but it would be fun to go with someone who was willing to joke around with me during the movie. I enjoy making side comments and joking about the content and acting of the film itself. I think it makes the film even more fun than if I just sat there watching it. After the movie, I would see if the other person wanted to go get ice cream and assuming they said yes, we would go and just sit and talk again and laugh and have a good time to finish off the night. If all went well, I would hope to see them again and spend more time with them. To add to the date, an ideal partner for me is a male that is funny, intelligent, kind, and mature. I would prefer that they be the same age as me, give or take a few years in either direction, but otherwise, I do not care so much about any other arbitrary things like appearance or money."

At dinner you can talk and get to know them, and also eat and you wouldn't have to get anything at the movies.Then once you go to the movies you can have a discussion about the film, afterwards to see their intelligence and understanding about the movie, and there would be no awkward silence. The date would be fun and full of conversations about their life and deeper thoughts to truly get to know them, what they are interested in and who they are as a person. I believe having conversation but also having time to think and be together in silence at the movies would create a deeper connection. I have went on dates like this before and it is very enjoyable. After the movies, he would drop me off and walk me to the door and tell me what a great night he had and ask me on another date, so we can get to know each other more and maybe start a relationship. I like for men to be a gentleman when going on dates. For example like paying for the dinner and movie, opening car doors, walking me to my door after the date and making sure I'm having a good time. Every girl wants their nice guy, who spoils them with attention and love and I believe after going on a nice date like that it could be possible. Other dates could also be just hanging out at the park or going to get coffee, anywhere would really work as long as you can talk and truly get to know one another. Haunted houses would also be an ideal date in the fall because, I get scared easily and it would be cute to have someone that's trying to protect me or make me laugh during that whole haunted house ordeal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

This would be nice for me because I usually plan everything we do and tend to plan more in advance. However, this night would be different. I would pick out an outfit that was new and made me feel beautiful. I wouldn't have to drive myself anywhere, he would pick me up at my house at the time he said he would. Upon picking me up, he would compliment me on how pretty I look. Also, he would be dressed in a nice outfit. Most of our dates are relatively casual, so it would be great to do something that feels more special. He would have it arranged for us to eat out at a classy, relatively nice Italian restaurant. It would be just a little bit chilly outside, and so on the way inside to the restaurant we would walk arm-in-arm. He would open the door for me and pull out my chair before I sit. All of the food would be authentic and fresh, which is important to me. The lighting would be romantic and there would be elegant music playing in the background. I would be able to order something new and exciting that I've never had before and love it. We would also order some kind of decadent dessert, like cheesecake or creme brulee. Even though I'm fine with paying for some things, this time he would offer to pay for it since it would be a special date. After we were finished eating, we would leave and drive to field in the middle of nowhere. My boyfriend would turn on our favorite song and ask me to dance outside of the car. The weather would be cool and crisp, and crickets would be chirping in the background. We would slow dance to the music and it would be just perfect. He would then lay out a picnic blanket in the grass and we'd lay out under the stars, talking about our lives and goals for the future. Topics might include the careers we want, where we want to live someday, how many kids we want, and any dreams we want to pursue. He might even set up his laptop and have a romantic movie ready to watch. We could cuddle up together and relax while enjoying the film, snacking on normal movie goodies. Once the movie was finished, we'd pack up and he'd drive me home, finishing it all off with a goodnight kiss."

My ideal location of this hike or backpacking trip would be in Colorado, California, or Wyoming. However, knowing that that is not idea for a college student, and that we don't live in one those places, there are a lot of camping areas within the Springfield and Missouri areas which are beautiful. It could be an afternoon, or it could be a whole weekend. If it were in Colorado, I would love to hike in the Keystone area. If it were in California, I think hiking by the ocean would be really cool, or hiking up to the top of a waterfall in Yosemite would be amazing. In Wyoming, I would love to go either to the Grand Teton National Forest or Yellowstone National Park. In Missouri, there are a lot of camping areas I would love to go too such as Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park, or the Mark Twain National Forest. The perfect temperature in which I would love to go to would be in the sixties to seventies in all locations. This wouldn't be too cold, but it wouldn't make us sweat either.  If it were a day hike, I would love if a guy picked me up early in the morning, and we would hike in the forest to a beautiful lake or an overview of the mountain that we just climbed. On this date, we would make a fire and cook our own lunch, and in the afternoon, we would relax. Towards the end of the day, we would pack up and clean our site, and hike back. If this was a weekend backpacking trip, I would enjoy hiking throughout the mountains all throughout the day. On a perfect trip, we would have a goal in mind in which we would like to stop and camp out, but we would not rush our hike. We would stop at scenic places along our way. Throughout this backpacking trip, we would laugh and have fun. We would talk about our lives, and our plans for the future. Since we would be backpacking for a weekend (two nights, and a only one full day) we would be able to pack and carry more normal foods. For breakfast, we would bring dehydrated eggs, and simple breakfast bars, and we might bring a small bottle of juice. For lunch, we would bring something quick and easy such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with some dried fruits and nuts. However, at dinner, we would have something big like instant potatoes, or instant soups. Even though we would have to bring our own food, we would not miss out on the dessert, such as materials for smores. "

I don't like awkwardness, so the most ideal partner for me would be someone who I can easily connect with and talk to before anything becomes romantic between us. I would want them to be able to come to my house and just watch movies without any awkward silences or situations. I would want my partner to be a good amount taller than me, with messy hair, glasses, and a cute smile. I want someone who I could make laugh and who could make me laugh easily. I don't really have a preference on appearance or features. I would want my ideal partner to be outgoing and spontaneous, who can deal with my busy schedule. I want him to have similar interests to me, but not the exact same to keep things interesting. The ideal date for me and this romantic partner would have to begin with an adventure. I want him to take us to a place we have never been to before. For example, an amusement park or vendors market. This would allow for great bonding and new memories to form. During this adventure we would laugh and enjoy ourselves while being very silly and humors. I would want him to buy me something, not necessarily expensive, to commemorate our experience together, and for me to have a token to look back to this day. After our adventure, I would want us to go somewhere we both enjoy, a casual restaurant, to eat. I would prefer a cute little restaurant that serves milkshakes and french fries, kind of like a little diner. We would both enjoy our dinner and share a milkshake together, cliche I know! I would want to take the back roads home because I would not want the night to end, and we would both end up driving around talking and singing as loudly as possible to our favorite throwback songs from our childhood. Once we go to my house, I would end up inviting him in to watch some movies because, again, I would not want the night to end. We would end up watching a movie we both enjoy, like a scary movie or something. Of course I would want things to get a little steamy, but not too much. I would want to enjoy a nice make out session and touching, but no sex. The anticipation is better. Then It would end with us falling asleep together cuddling. "

Afterwards we would go on boat ride into the sunset and watch it in each other's arms. After the sun goes down we would go to a country concert on the pier. Probably Luke Bryan or Jason Aldean or Kenny Chesney or Thomas Rhett. We would have front row tickets. It would be so so cool and fun and awesome. Another really really really fun date would be going to a professional soccer game and watching Manchester United beat Chelsea. We would ride in a limo to the stadium and also have front row tickets at half field. Manchester United would probably win at lease three to zero if not more. Then we would meet all of the Man U players after they demolished Chelsea and they would sign our jerseys. Another fun date would be going to a Blues hockey game and watching them beat the Chicago Blackhawks. We would see Taresanko and Pietrangelo and many other St. Louis Blues players on the ice. Another perfect date would be going to the St. Louis Arch and riding all the way to the top and looking at the city. Then having dinner at the three sixty roof top.

On top of my bed would also be a note from them that says what time they would pick me up from my home. Once they arrived at my door, they would then blind fold me and drive to a ""surprise"" location. The location would either be the beach, a fancy restaurant, a park, a fair, or a sentimental location that is important to us. He would then take the blind fold off and we would then have a picnic if it was at a park or beach. We would then stay out until midnight and then go back to his place where we would watch Netflix romance movies. Before we would turn on Netflix, he would give me a shirt of his to wear so I would not be uncomfortable from wearing my outfit from earlier. We would order Dominos and eat extra cheese pizza and hot molten lava cakes together with a glass of milk. We would eat and then spend the whole first movie talking and making fun of the characters in the film and also we would discuss all the plot holes and the predictable story line. I would then fall asleep on him after eating and half way into our second movie that night. Oh and there would be random making out during the date. He'd clean up all the food mess while I was asleep and if we weren't already in bed, he'd carry me to bed and tuck me in, as well as get into bed with me and we'd go to bed. Possibly bang.The next morning, I'd sleep longer than him and he would wake up first. He'd go to the kitchen after kissing my forehead and he'd make coffee and pour two cups, one of them made just how I like it. I'd wake up to the smell of breakfast cooking and I'd come into the kitchen and sit at the table while he cooked breakfast for the two of us. By the time he'd be done cooking breakfast, which would consist of pancakes, eggs, bacon and some hash browns, it would be about noon and so we'd finish breakfast and go and get ready for our days. As I prepare to go about my day, I would sigh to myself, but a sigh of delight as I reminisced about the grand adventure that was my wonderful perfect date with my wonderful perfect romantic partner. And yet there would be a tinge of sadness in said sigh, knowing that such a perfect date and wonderful evening was now over and done with, and that while such an event could certainly happen once again it would never quite reach such the same level of wonderment and delight simply because I had already experienced it, and that one day both of us would depart this world into the vast unknown of death and never experience such a day again. And so, as usual, right after the highest of highs I'd be suddenly struck with the lowest of lows, courtesy of my brain. "

The partner would have to be funny, likely to be about the same person in personality as myself to find like interests in each other but with some other unlike interests to get each others attention so we would have more to talk about. The personality of this person would have to be both outrageous and strange enough to be deal with my quirky personality and slightly bipolar personality as well. Moving on to the date itself, my ideal date would have to be a simple dinner and a movie. The only catch is the dinner really, I would enjoy just sharing a high quality 3-4 course meal at a 5 star restaurant somewhere very expensive to eat. The reason to eat at an expensive restaurant to me is because my past love of food to get a taste of expensive restaurants and probably in my mind to impress this date. Otherwise, the meal would be just mainly for me with them getting whatever courses they would want and I would end up getting something like soup and salad, a big steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and then a dessert, maybe cheesecake to end it. I would leave the movie to be seen up to my partner that I was with, hopefully they would choose a scary movie, but chick flicks or romantic comedies would alright as well. If they were still hungry after the large 3-4 course meal then we would get popcorn and drinks but that would be up to them mainly after the meal. During the movie of course we would cuddle in the movie seats, especially if it was a scary movie they would probably just curl up with me and if it wasn't then I would probably slip a move anyway and cuddle up anyway. After the date I would like to walk them home and make sure they got home safe and have a long conversation just about anything that pops up. I would make sure I say goodnight and then make sure that they were home safe. If my partner would like me to come in like every other movie type romance happens then, I would but I would be very cautious with it because I would be in their home so I would respect their home and respect what I can and can't do. Before I leave I would make sure I got at least a kiss because that would be an ideal ending to the night honestly."

I love romance but I?m also very practical when it comes to dates. If we?re both struggling college students, going to eat at a really fancy place may be too much. Don?t get me wrong, it would be incredibly thoughtful, but I?m sure we would have just as much fun somewhere cheaper. My perfect date is more of a whole day thing than an evening thing. The date would probably start out with us not really having anything planned. I?m not usually a very spontaneous person, so it would be nice if I could be comfortable enough with someone to just do things in the moment. That?s probably not the smartest approach to love but it sure sounds like a good time. I?ve always liked the idea of taking impromptu miniature road trips. There are quite a few beautiful hiking places I would love to take my partner. After hiking for a while, we could go and get lunch at a cheap but fun restaurant. I?m a pretty casual person so being more laid back is probably the best. After that we could spend the rest of the time exploring the town we?re at or play with animals because cute animals plus a cute date is a win-win situation. Or we could take that time to do whatever my partner wants to do. A romantic relationship is a two-way street after all. When we get tired, we can go back to someone?s place and watch movies together. Or, if the weather is good, we could have a bonfire. Bonfires are one of my favorite things. Because I naturally touch people a lot, I would love to hold hands, snuggle, etc. throughout the date. I guess not having any expectations to act a certain way or feel pressure would be the ideal atmosphere for my date. I feel like a great date involves both people having fun and feeling safe with each other. Also, sharing what you love with the person you love is one of the most amazing parts of going on dates. Honestly, as I was planning this out, I feel like there are a lot of things I would be okay with doing that I usually wouldn?t just because I?m sure to have fun with my partner wherever we go. I?m sure this will change because the ideal partner will probably change to resemble the person I?m dating at the time. Taking into consideration their personality/interests will change the dynamic of ideal dates."

His hair would be swept to the side like he knows I love. We would head out for a nice dinner at a romantic restaurant that he had made reservations at the night before. The lighting would be low, maybe candlelit, and there would be soft music playing. We would eat all the food we wanted at dinner and share a dessert afterwards. We wouldn't choose anything that had peanut butter or caramel in it. He would have a glass of red wine, and I would take in the scent of his breath from across the table. After dinner, we would go to a movie of my choice. During the movie, we would raise the armrest between our chairs and get as close to one another as we possibly could. He would not be watching the movie. ""Why would I watch people on a screen when the most beautiful girl in the world is sitting by my side?"" he would say. I would wonder how I got so lucky.We would leave the movie and go to our favorite coffee shop downtown. We would stay there talking about nothing until they kicked us out. Then we drive around and find a park or a field to lay down in and just look at the stars. I am always cold, but he would have thought to bring me an extra jacket. We would stare up at the sky and talk about what our life will be like in the future. ""My dear, you are even more lovely than this picture above us,"" he would whisper, as he softly kissed my forehead. I would fall asleep on his warm chest. He would let me sleep a while, taking comfort in my slow, even breaths, before carrying me to his car. I would insist I could walk, but he would say it is his pleasure. The night would end with him taking the long way to drive me home and playing songs he thinks I would like or that remind him of me. He would walk me to the door and kiss me goodnight. I would stare out the window until I saw his taillights disappear into the darkness of the night. After I had showered and crawled into bed, I would see a text pop up on my phone's screen. ""I hope you enjoyed our time together. My love for you is greater than the distance to the furthest star we saw tonight. Sleep well, my darling""."

I'm one that likes to be busy so I'd like to do a variety of different things. I think my ideal date is one that lasts for a whole day. Since this is with my ideal romantic partner I'm gonna want to spend all day with him. I'd first probably start with going out to eat for breakfast. My favorite breakfast place is First Watch so that's probably where I'd want to go but I always love to try new places so if he were to take me to a surprise restaurant that he likes I'd love that. After breakfast maybe it'd be fun to go to a local art museum or something of the sorts. Or perhaps a local gem. Depending on what time we're at in the day at this point, perhaps attending some sort of sporting event would be fun. I've always wanted to go to a professional tennis match as I play tennis so that'd be super cool if at all possible. Then maybe to a mini golf course after the match is over for a little night time mini golf. I always love a good game of mini golf. Then I think I'd want to go to the grocery store and buy food together that we could take back to my apartment and cook up something delicious together. Maybe make some shrimp pasta? Throw in some chocolate strawberries for dessert and we're set. Then to just relax and cuddle on the couch and turn on a good movie. Maybe a scary movie, maybe an action movie, whatever we decide on really. This would all depend, of course, on money being no object but It'd sure be the ideal date for me.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

One of the best dates would be in Nashville.  We would get up and go eat brunch at one of the many brunch places.  One of us would probably get a sweet breakfast meal and the other would probably get a lunch entr?e.  Have Brunch we would probably go see some form of the sites.  It would be very romantic to go somewhere with beautiful flowers and trees that just envelop you into nature.  After the park of sorts we would probably go to a museum or walk downtown.  The best place would probably be some place that had dogs running everywhere.  At some point we might pass by a flower shop and he would grab a flower or two for me and then I would just be head over heals.  Later we would go get dinner at a nice restaurant where we could split a good meal for a good price.  It would be great to have an evening stroll through one of the nice neighborhoods where the only thing to do is to imagine what the inside of the houses looked like and even possibly plan your future together.  Even discussing a future (if you?ve been dating a while) would be super romantic and show how committed that person is.  Later we would finish the night with a sweet kiss to the cheek then forehead then nose and finally a sweet peck to the lips.	Eventually if the relationship is meant to be I?m sure there would be lots of difficulties.  Relationships aren?t always perfect but the moments that are can be fantastic.  Sweet, cheap dates are always a good way to put fire in the relationship.  Sweet little cheese fries and karaoke dates have to be the best.  The guy could get up and sing his passionate little heart to the one he loves.  That would be a great little make-up date in case there was a problem that had surfaced.  Eventually you?ll either break up or marry each other.  The ultimate goal is marriage.  You?d have cute little kids and live in a safe little neighborhood in Nashville.  You?d be superhero?s in their eyes.  But of course, with kids comes trouble?s and you?ll end up fighting and crying and eventually wanting to give in.  However you stay because you have kid?s together and he is the most love of your life and your middle aged with a mini van."

As I am a pretty laid back person, I don't desire material things so going on a simple dinner date or picnic would be nice. I would enjoy getting dinner at a place with a small quiet outdoor patio or even getting sandwiches from a to go place and having a picnic.  As a first date, I would like to either go hiking or fishing so that a lot of conversation can take place. I really like to spend time outdoors and so if I would like to date someone who desires that as well.  If we have been together for a while, I always enjoy going to sports games with others, especially hockey games.  In the summer and spring, I like to swim and spend time with my friends.  I think it is important that they are able to have conversations with my friends, so that it is not awkward to be with both my partner and my friends.  I would suggest going to the lake as a group to interact with everyone.  In the fall and winter, I love to snuggle up and sit by a bonfire.  I think this is a great way to talk and get to know your partner even more.  My ideal romantic partner would be someone who is caring and compassionate and also a good listener.  Along with being a good listener, they need to be open so that I can trust and emphasize with them.  When people only listen to what others say and don't share anything about themselves it is hard to make a connection with them.  In my opinion, a romantic partner should be protective when they need to be without controlling my every move, this is a trust thing.  I always live by the thought of you should trust someone until they prove you wrong.  I would do that for them, so I would expect them to do the same for me.  Also depending on what season it is my ideal date may change.    I've always been attracted to guys that are family oriented and hard workers.  I think being close to your family really teaches people how they should treat others because you wouldn't want anyone to talk badly about your family so you shouldn't be talking bad about other peoples.  I think men who are family oriented growing up are typically also good with kids which is obviously important to think about when looking for a life partner. "

He would also have to have a good sense of humor because I am very sarcastic. He would also have to love dogs because I want five, but not cats because I am allergic. I would like him to enjoy spontaneous adventures because that is what I'm about. I do not want a man that is clingy, that is too much for me as a person. He is gonna have to deal with my sassy attitude that goes on basically twenty four seven. 	My perfect date with my ideal romantic partner would be going to watch a movie. We would watch a comedy like, Why Him? so I could laugh at lot. Then after that we would go to Steak 'n Shake so I could get a cheeseburger, cheese fries, and a milkshake. He would have chicken fingers, fries, a milkshake and perhaps a salad. He would make sure to take the receipt and pay for it all because he is such a gentleman. Then we would go backroading for a little bit, and then we would go to a scenic view and look at the stars. Then we would watch Friends on Netflix till the break of dawn, after that we would part ways for a couple of hours, and then we would meet up again and go to the Zoo. We would go look at the penguins, brown bears (#bearup), panda bears, black bears, sloths, tigers, lions, gorillas, seals, turtles, giraffes, kangaroos, elephants, hippos, cheetahs, sea lions, birds, frogs, and last but not least zebras. He would then take me out to eat at taco bell because cheap dates are the best dates. I would then suggest going to the Art Museum, so we could look at all of the artwork. I would crack jokes and he would laugh at them and tell me how funny I am. 	The perfect date cannot just last one fraction of a day, it has to span out within a few days so you can experience all of the fun that you and your significant other deserve. You have to enjoy the time that you all have together because you never know when you do not get that time together anymore. Romantic dates are not for everyone, sometimes things like this change your mind. Honestly any date would be good with me, I am not a picky person. I love to go on adventures, and why not make it with the man I care about. "

I imagine the perfect woman as either a blonde or brunette, most likely brunette.(sorry redheads and others) As long as she taller than about 5'4"" I don't think we'd have a problem. Hopefully she's into sports, I'm trying to breed a future pro athlete to support me later in life. Ideally, she's going to have an incredible sense of humor. We'll be able to joke about anything. We would get to know one another while telling jokes that don't make any sense. I'd probably quote a few tv shows, mainly the office, if she doesn't get those then it's probably not meant to be. Then we would proceed to take our talents to a carnival where I win her heart by winning all the stuffed-animals known to man. I also imagine myself knocking her socks off by ringing the bell on the game where you strike the sensor with a sledgehammer. She'll likely be thinking, ""Wow, I've never seen such a strong manly man. I want to marry him on the spot."" Hopefully at some point in the night some other man would try to disrespect her, and I would step in and fend him off. If she's not in love with me at this point I'm not sure what else I could do. Maybe we'd see a movie somewhere in there(horror or comedy). Maybe I could convince someone to put Benchwarmer's or Step Brother's.(classics) Then I'd take her home and hopefully get a kiss goodbye. I imagine at this point that literal sparks would fly, and the temperature outside would likely dramatically change. Maybe a lightning bolt strikes the ground a few yards away from us.(a safe distance.) In conclusion, this may sound fishy, but that's just my personality and in my head this is my idea of a perfect date. I've written three-hundred words so I'm not sure what else to talk about. I hope this doesn't hurt your study but just take into consideration everything I've spoke of up to this point. I think now I'll talk about another great date idea. I'd probably take a girl to a basketball game and hopefully she's able to get into the game. Otherwise we will have a serious problem. If you recall what I mentioned above my ideal woman is interested in sports. Hopefully she's getting really into the game shouting obscenity's at the players and other fans. Maybe there will even be a cat fight that breaks out. So I hope you've enjoyed my idea of a perfect date(s)."

We go together so well that we can just hangout and be goofy best friends and I will completely enjoy myself. If I had to construct the ""perfect date"", it would be a date that my boyfriend and I have already done except he would plan everything out for me and surprise me instead of me planning everything. On this perfect date we first went to the store together and bought a bunch of fruit, chips, drink, and sandwich stuff. I made us sandwiches and cut up the fruit and put it all into a cute little picnic basket. Next we went to an empty beach (I live on lake Erie) and had a quiet little picnic on the beach together. We ate food, talked, laughed. walked up and down the beach, and enjoyed our company together. After the beach we packed up and took a truck to the drive in movies. We filled the bed of the truck with blankets and pillows and cuddled up for two movies. We had drinks, popcorn, and candy. It was a perfect night together. After the movies we went back to his house and slept until 6a.m. we woke up and went and got Burger King breakfast together and wore the burger king crowns back home and slept until 10. The only thing that would have made it a more perfect date would be if he would have surprised me with everything, and bought me flowers. Roses of course. Anytime spent with him is perfect though and I would never complain about any date we go on together. All dates with him are perfect.

I want to be able to talk to the person that I am spending my time with. Some sort of food, most likely dinner, would be preferred. But I would also want something that is different. I would enjoy going to a place that I have never been or learning about something that I had no knowledge of beforehand. I would not want to be on a schedule, or feel rushed. A date is one those events in life that should always have the motto ""go with the flow"" attached to it. What I more concerned with is the emotions that I would want to feel on the date. I want to be happy, excited, surprised, or thrilled. At the end of the night if I am not feeling, at the very least, content, then I highly doubt that I would consider it a successful date. I have only ever been on a few dates and all of them were not good experiences or things that I would ever reference when talking about happiness. But those dates did teach me what I do not want, and little bit of what I do. I do not want awkward, uncomfortable silence, or for the conversation to seem, in any way shape or form, forced. I want a little bit of fire. Someone he can shock me. I want someone who will not bend to my every whim. I do not want to plan the date, but I want my partner to know me enough to know that I will like it, if not love it. When the date is over I want to feel like I do not want to leave yet. Like we have not finished our conversation. I have been on the receiving end of the typical ""I had fun tonight."" text, after the most silent date of my life. I never responded to that text, and to this day it is one the things that I am most ashamed about. But what reply should I have given? ""No, you did not."" Or the cynical part of me wanted to say ""Why? I did not."" or ""Why are you lying?"" I saw that guy about a year later, at my work, and I had to stand there and take his order, along with his family's, with all of that shame and guilt weighing me down. My fight or flight response kicked in, and I really just wanted to go hide in the back of the storage room. Now when I think about that entire situation I do not have a single good though or emotion. It is not at all about the actual date itself. It is about how you feel about your time spent with a specific person. But if the date does end in a good light, it does not reflect well on the person that planned the disaster. I am not blaming it entirely on him. I know that I should have tried more, and ultimately I think it came down to the fact that we had absolutely no chemistry, which is another priority of mine."
61,Tessa Hope Shaffer,Female,18,White,4,5,3,4,1,5,1,5,2,5,4,2,1,5,3,3,5,4,1,2,3,1,3,1,5,5,5,3,5,1,1,1,5,4,5,5,5,2,5,1,1,2,5,1,4,3,5,5,1,1,"I would not consider myself to be a particularly high-maintenance person or even say that I have any real expectations when it comes to what my partner has planned - if anything at all - for a date. I think the whole point of a date is that you are spending time with your partner. I am perfectly content with staying in or going out for a date because that is not what matters. What you are actually doing during that time and where that time is spent are less important than the interactions between you and your partner during that time.That being said, an ideal date for me would be anytime that we have set aside for one another  in order to learn more about each other or to just spend time together. Where this occurs means little to nothing to me. Whether it is over coffee at a diner, playing video games in a basement, or at some nonsense art museum is irrelevant. What's important is the connection that is being made and the time that is being spent together. Something that I do not find appealing is when interactions are forced and overly planned. In a situation like this, I think it is important that the interaction should occur and progress naturally. While we are together, if I were to mention really wanting to see a movie or really wanting a burger, and my partner agrees, we would would then go do either of those things. This would be a perfect date to me because it is perfectly suited to whatever my partner and I so desire in that moment, and it is not focused on or intending to be some flawless and planned event. Any date can be a ""perfect date"" as long as the time you spend together is more focused on the purpose of being together and experiencing things together rather than just doing something because you thought it was a good idea for a date.I think we are seeing a lot more malcontent in relationships recently, and I believe this is due to people's expectations being influenced by things like the media, films, and books. There is a major push for things to be ""perfect."" If he does not pay for everything, if he does not bring you flowers, if the date is not elaborate and well thought-out, if it does not end with a kiss, then how much does he really care? Are you really being appreciated? This is a flawed and unrealistic way to view dating. "

I am not very interested in spending lots of money to have a good time. I would really like to spend the day together. Have lunch in the park somewhere. Nothing fancy or extravagant or expensive. Just a simple lunch while sitting in the park enjoying each other?s company and the scenery. After that, I would like to just ride around and talk about different things and listen to music. Whenever that got done, I would really like to throw blankets out and lay in an open field somewhere and just look at the stars and talk. I just would like to spend some quality time together and enjoy each other?s company. After sitting out and watching the stars, I would like to go to a small shop or something and grab a drink and just sit somewhere and hang out. I would want to just hang around, maybe go on a walk on a chilly, fall night. I think when going on a date, communication is one of the most important things to do throughout the whole time. I would want to talk about different things such as who they are, what their interests are, what makes them happy, what saddens them, why they are the way they are, and what makes them unique. I like to know all about someone and I want to be with someone who is willing to communicate and actually talk to me about anything and everything.Another thing I would want in a date in the guy choosing what he wants to do an actually planning things out. I think that effort from a guy is one of the things I look for the most because i believe in relationships being half and half. I would like if the guy took charge for once and actually showed interest and proved that he was going to put in effort as well. I think that girls should put in just as much effort as boys do, but I would like for things to be half and half. Lastly, I would want my date to be caring, and a great listener. I wouldn?t like doing all of the talking, but whenever I would talk I would want someone to have patience to let me have the spotlight to talk and be able to express my feelings as well. I just was to have genuine, authentic fun with someone without have to be nervous or on my toes. I don?t want to have to constantly walk on eggshells whenever I am around someone."

I say big field because I think privacy is the best for someone to really get to know someone. I would want to be laying in the back of bed of a truck with my date tucked under a bunch of fuzzy blankets, with good old country music playing lighting in the background on the radio. Laying in the back of a truck bed, cuddling up to my partner on the cool night, staring up at the stars in the middle of a field. To make the night even better, I would want there to be my dog, Bocephus, laying there with us cuddled up to us under the covers although he would just be wild and jumping around. There would be lots of sweet tea and hot wings next to us to munch on all night because those are my favorite things. Before laying in the back of the truck, a cute picnic while the sun sets would be ideal. My partner could make the dinner so it would be a surprise. We would sit in the middle of the field on a blanket eating dinner watching the sun set over the trees around us. After dinner, we would slow dance under the moonlight to the sound of country music all night until all the stars will brightly lit into the night sky. I am the type of girl who really likes board games so playing board games in the back of the truck under the moonlight. We could play monopoly and play all night but our favorite board game is Sequence. We could even go see a drive in movie afterwards and make use of the bed of the truck because you can watch the movie from there. We could bring our dog or take him on a walk through the woods and play fetch with him. We could start a fire later that night on the field and cook up some hot dogs and smores. I think it is really romantic and really nice to get to know someone with privacy like that, sitting around a campfire, singing along to Thomas Rhett on the radio while my dog howls in the back ground. it seems like a really cheesy date but I am extremely old school and find things like this romantic. I find this more romantic than taking a girl to a club or a party and getting to know them that way. A movie or a picnic or somewhere private is the best way to get to know someone."

I would want the guy to come to my house to pick me up. He could introduce himself to my parents and at least have a bit of common sense to respect that my parents are there to try and protect me from a broken heart. Anyways, I would like to go out to a nice dinner and no, nasty McDonald's doesn't count. After dinner, I would like to go to see something really unique that might not be something that everyone gets to do all the time. For example, seeing an exhibit or going to a special tour of the royals or chiefs stadium. Then going to a movie or even going somewhere to watch movies or Netflix would be nice. I know that for me, it is important to see what the guys intentions with not only me but his future are. It is important to get to know him and who he is and the things he likes because if you clash with him and some of his interests things might not work out. I really love going to Italian food so that could be where we go to dinner. Maybe go bowling after or to just go driving around. I really would enjoy going on a date to the ice rink in the winter and then enjoy Christmas movies and hot chocolate after. I feel as if I have so many different perfect date ideas that would be so romantic. It is pretty funny that I have never even been taken out on a date before though! I think that guys at my age are still young and dumb so trying to get them to settle down is hard.

I would want it to be face to face. The guy has to be very mature and smooth with his words. After we got that out of the way, I would most likely want to enjoy nature. Those are the best dates. Long walks in the woods, maybe a picnic there as well. We would pack sandwiches and some fruit and eat on the top of the hill just watching the birds and nature. After that, I would enjoy swimming in the creek. Splashing each other and wrestling in the water. And laugh until the sun went down. After that, I would enjoy a nice four-wheeler ride in the dark. Him driving, of course, and me holding onto his stomach. We would drive through every square inch of property I own. After that, going back to my house and watching movies together would be the best. Cuddling, eating pizza and ice cream, and drinking sparkling grape juice while watching either a scary or romantic movie. Another amazing date would be driving to the city and eating a romantic dinner, preferably at The Cheesecake Factory. The boy also better be paying for the food and driving. Then after we eat and get dessert, driving backroads home, and then playing a little basketball would be fun to work off the food we just ate. He also better let me win. Sitting outside and listening to music on the deck talking about our childhood, our life now, and the future. Maybe enjoying a beer while we are at it. Another date I would like to go on would be leaving the state of Missouri and going on a road trip. I would enjoy a road trip to Florida. Going to the beach and staying in a condo. A week would be about good enough for me. Every night we go to a seafood restaurant and eat all we can. Then at night go back to the condo and make Pina Coladas and drink on the balcony just listening to the ocean crash. During the daytime, snorkling and swimming with the dolphins would be something I would want to do. ANother trip would be going out west. Heading to Colorado, and staying in the mountains just riding four-wheelers and enjoying the nature. ALso heading to the Grand Canyon and hiking that. O have always wanted to do that and if my partner would also want to do that, he would be a keeper."

I would also want to learn as much as possible about her, and I would ask a lot of questions. Secondly, I would want to have fun. And, I would also want her to have fun. Some things I might find fun for any date would be attending a rock concert, going hiking, or going out to dinner. I would also make sure to compliment my date. I think the most important thing about any perfect date with anyone would be the location. Location is very important, because if one person enjoys the location and the other person does not enjoy the location, then you might know that that person is not for you. If she does not like nature, or rock concerts, then you find out more about her as a person. Another really important factor to a perfect date is how you present yourself. You want to have a good, eloquent speaking voice, and speak clearly. You also do not want to smell, so make sure to shower before hand. Depending on the person, you might want to shave. Or you might not want to, it is up to the person. Another really important factor to any date, or having any friend, is being able to talk to the other person and hold a conversation with them. If you can not do that, then the date will get boring and you might not see them another time. You also want to make sure you talk about the right stuff. If you are trying to establish a first impression, you do not want to come off as someone who is weird. Another good aspect of a date is being chivalrous. I think guys should hold the door open for girls, pull the chair out for them, open the car door, etc. I also want to make sure that I am nice to the girl, and that the girl is nice to me. If the girl likes someone who is aggressive, not nice, and mean, then she is not the one for me. These things are good to know when going out with someone. You should also make sure to be neast and tidy. If you drive, make sure that you have a clean car that smells nice. You should also make sure to stand out from other guys she might have dated. This way, you stand out and she remembers you and wants to see you again. You should also a feature that makes you stand out fro others, like a guy with long hair for example. "

Me and my boyfriend are both very busy people so we rarely have time to stop and have an actual date together. I guess my ideal date would actually be a weekend. I work 70 hours a week and have not been able to go on vacation in years, so I would love to visit the aquarium in Georgia with him. I would love to fly down on a Friday and spend the whole day Saturday at the aquarium. I don't like being stressed out or pressed for time so I wouldn't want to have to go back to Springfield that day. I would love to be able to be there as soon as the aquarium opened, and get a map and make a game plan so that we would be able to hit all the fun spots within the aquarium. I would also like to go sit down for dinner, not at an expensive restaurant but maybe somewhere on the beach outside. I haven't seen the ocean since I was 5 or 6 so I would love to be able to see the ocean and maybe even walk in it some. I am however terrified of large bodies of water, so I don't think I would want to swim in it. So it isn't very detailed but that would be my ideal date.\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "

Maybe 5'10"". He's handsome with a sort of crooked smile. It's a million dollar smile, though. His hair is a tad scruffy. He wears a blue button-down and worn down jeans. I wear a yellow dress and wedges. I curled my hair. I feel self conscious and slightly overdressed, but he compliments me and assures me I look terrific. We start the night walking downtown. The bright signs light up the street and our fingers are intertwined as he leads me through the shops. We go to the arcade where we play various games and at the few that are two player games, he playfully lets me win the ones I am not so hot at. I kick butt at Dig Dug and Q*bert. They're my best games. He easily beats me at any sport themed games. I am ridiculously bad at them. After a bit, we leave and he takes me to my favorite restaurant downtown. I order my favorite dish, an egg cheeseburger, and out of curiosity, he orders the same. He takes a big bite, as guys usually do, and egg shoots down his arm. Surprised, we both laugh. I give him my fries because I do not like potatoes. We leave the restaurant and he takes me to the ice cream shop. Since I ordered dinner, I make him choose the ice cream. I drop mine on the sidewalk and he offers me his and we share. We walk back to his truck and he drives me back to our apartment. I lead him up the stairs and about halfway up, he kisses me. Soft at first, but then he kisses harder. I pull him closer and then I pull away. I pull him into the apartment and lead him to the bedroom... and... well, to be blunt, we have sex. It's cold in the apartment, but our bodies are hot. He kisses my neck and chest and nibbles on my ear. He undresses me and my dress falls to the floor, gracefully draped around my feet. My fingers struggle to unbutton his shirt but he doesn't hesitate to help. I undo his pants and he unclasps my bra. I lead him to the bed and we crawl under the covers and kiss again. We make love. Afterwards, we fall asleep in each other's arms and he holds me close under the covers. Morning comes and I wake up to the sun shining. I lean over and kiss his nose and he smiles with his eyes still closed. I get up and pull a t-shirt over my head and go make hot chocolate for the two of us. I top them off with whip cream. He kisses me on the forehead and leaves for work. "

We would get pizza and cake.The pizza would be pineapple on one half and hamburger with bacon on the other, mainly because we couldn't decide on what type of pizza and decided on doing a two in one deal. During dinner we would talk about all our favorite thing. He would say how much he adores his dog he has at home and how he loves doing things with his family. I would tell him I like to travel the world and visit different countries.  We would laugh and be totally relaxed around each other. Then he would say how he wants to take her to his favorite place in town. He wouldn't tell her were she would be going. When we got there, the was beautiful. It was a secret park that not many people knew about. He said that he would play there as a child, and always wanted to have his kids grow up playing in the same park. He said he would want them to make as many great memories in the park as he did. After the park we would go see a movie, most likely action. If any Marvel movies were playing, that is what we would go see. If not them we would most likely watch a cute, romantic movie were we could hold hand and cuddle. We would also get popcorn with extra butter and sweet tarts.  After the movie we would go dancing. We would find a club, that is popular, but not too popular. Enough to were we can get in the door, but not be the only ones there. Also the dance floor would have to be a little crowded, but still have room so you are not stepping on everyone. Finally they would end their night taking a small walk, mainly to cool off from all the dancing. They would talk more about how they want to travel and see different place and experience new foods. She would say that she had a great night and she would love to do it again soon. He would say that it was one of the best nights he had had in a long time and that he couldn't wait until next time. After an adventurous night we would call it a night and he would walk me back to my door, but not before I got a goodnight kiss. Also we would make plans for our next date, and it would be out of town or even like a small vacation to a different town or state. I would tell him that I have always wanted to go to California and he would say that he will take me there one day. Also he would mention that he has never learned how to ski, and she said she  would take him one day. "

I think it would have to start out with being with someone I knew really well. Boyfriends haven?t historically worked out extremely great for me, so I?ve come to the conclusion that my ideal boyfriend would be someone I have been friends with for plenty of time, and it kind of just develops into a relationship. An ideal date for me wouldn?t have to be something especially expensive or extravagant, but just something creative and thoughtful that shows he really cares. I like it when guys pay for me every once and a while because I believe chivalry should not die. Anyways, I played softball when I was younger and though I don?t play anymore, I now really enjoy watching baseball. I think it would be very nice to be taken out for lunch or dinner and then to watch a baseball game. Again, the meal doesn?t have to be at anywhere very fancy or expensive, just at a restaurant that has a fun atmosphere that has good food. Ideally, I wouldn?t have to tell my date where I want to go; I can never seem to decide what I want to eat so I would just want him to make a decision and take me there. At the restaurant, conversation would be flowing well, obviously since we are basically best friends as I said earlier. After we finished our meals, we would head to the baseball game. It would definitely be a Royals game because they reign supreme over all other baseball teams. Although I know my date can?t control weather, it would be ideal if it wasn?t blazing hot outside so I don?t get sweaty and uncomfortable. So, my ideal date might have to take place in early October. I wouldn?t really want the really expensive close seats because in my opinion, the seats that are further up in the stadium are better because you have an aerial view of thee entire field. After the game, we would head back to one of our houses where we could cuddle and nap and probably watch The Office. If we were hungry again at this point, cereal or popcorn would have to be the next meal since those are my two favorite foods. With all of this being said, I really honestly would enjoy any date a guy thoughtfully set up for me. I love trying new things so any date where we could jump into a new situation would certainly be great too."

Me and my boyfriend Austin have been dating for almost 2 years. We met in high school cross country and became friends before we began dating. Austin  is my ideal romantic partner because he is smart, funny, nice, understanding. Austin always knows how to make me laugh and make me smile even on my worst days. He knows exactly what I need when I?m upset and not only loves me despite my quirks, but has learned to love my quirks because that?s who I am. I love that Austin has always supported me and he has helped me through everything I?ve been through. He has loved and supported me through finding out that I have a uncurable genetic syndrome, two shoulder surgeries in the recoveries, an estranged father, and all the bad days that come with those. But most of all what I love about Austin is how genuine he is; I never feel like I have to pretend or be someone else when I?m with him. He is my favorite person to be with and the first person I go to with good news, and the first I want to comfort me when I get bad news. I love Austin more than I can explain in words.My ideal date would be with Austin as he is my ideal person. We have always wanted to go and visit the ocean or the beach together. We have both gone to the beach separately with our families, and loved the experience. However, we have always talked about wanting to go together one day. I would love to take him to Galveston Island in Texas. I went to Galveston Island with my family last summer and it was the most beautiful place I?ve ever seen. The dolphins would follow the ferry boats from the island to the mainland and the water was so clear that you could see fish whenever the waves would come up and crash. I would love to learn how to surf with Austin or paddle board in the ocean. Me and Austin love to go swimming together and we usually go a couple times a week during the summer. Even after my surgery where I wasn?t able to go swim, Austin and I would go to the pool. I would sit on the edge of the pool and dip my feet in while he would wade in the pool next to me and tell me jokes. That is why my perfect date would be just me and Austin at Galveston beach."

The reason why I chose this scenery is because it is quiet and you?re with nature.  There?s no sirens or the busy city life, it?s just you and your significant other. I could see myself waking up with my significant other, drinking coffee on the front porch, enjoying the morning. After our coffee and breakfast, I would like to go explore the woods/country side wherever we are at for a few hours.  I want us to just enjoy one another and for us to relax. Who knows we might run around like little kids and play games for a while.  If we went while it cold or snowing, I would love to stay inside and cuddle while watching movies and eating our favorite snacks.  For lunch, we could either go out to eat or just make a little homecooked meal but nothing too big, because dinner and desert is where it?s at. I just like to relax if you haven?t noticed yet.  For diner we will either go outside for a cute, little, healthy picnic out on a blanket facing the water or the fireplace.  The desert with be fruit covered in chocolate, but we will be dipping them ourselves because it?s honestly healthier for you.  We will end the night watching the stars, cuddling, keeping each other warm, while sipping some wine, eating more chocolate covered fruit if wanted.  In case you?re wondering who, my perfect significant other is in my opinion is someone who is loving, loyal, family-orientated, disciplined, patriotic, etc.  I want someone who is going to love me for me.  Someone who will stay no matter how hard it gets, who keeps their promises to me. I see him being happy with his life and job. I want him to have my views that everything happens for a reason, that there?s always light at the end of the tunnel.  The end of the day I want to be able to look at him and feel like I am at home just being in his presence.  I don?t want my past to affect the way someone loves me.  I don?t want my dad getting in the way once again.  My dad and most of my family always interfere with everything when it comes to me being happy. I want my significant other to love me for me and to take me away from everyone and everything.   "

Even though I am a huge fan of both food and movies, it just never did anything for me. It's so basic and everyone does it. Maybe once in a while it is fun and spontaneous, but every weekend is a no go. So if I had to pick an ideal date, I would have to go with something along the lines of something adventurous. For example, going on a hike into unknown territory and then going to a restaurant neither of us have been to before would be fun for me and I think her. I have actually done something like this one time and it was last year in Chicago. Me and my girlfriend went to Chicago with my family and we went out on our own one day to explore the park just outside of downtown Chicago. It was new for both of us so we were just going with the flow. There were no plans for the day so we just did whatever we wanted and walked wherever we wanted. I've been to Chicago multiple times so I know a lot of good restaurants, but we both decided to mix it up. We asked our taxi driver where a good restaurant is. And we went to a very strange place that served every part of a pigs body to eat. It was decent food but the experience made it a million times better. So for me it's all about being adventurous and having a good time. It's not about spending a ton of money to impress her or to show off. Having fun is the only thing that matters to me. If she's having fun then I'm having fun. But before I plan anything I always ask if there's something that she wants to do. And if not then I (most of the time) plan something fun. Whether it's just mini golfing, a drive in movie, or doing something completely new. If I could do absolutely anything in the world, it would be going back packing in Washington and a picnic in the mountains or something along those lines. It's different and I've always wanted to go backpacking and picnics are always ""cute"" and girls love it. So I think that would be ideal for me if I could do absolutely anything. But I understand that is an ""extreme date"" and is not very possible to do when you live in the middle of Missouri. And it would be very expensive to fly out there, get a hotel, and all the necessities to do this. But I still think it would be a blast and both me and her would enjoy it. "

It doesn't have to be anything specific, just an activity that allows us to get in touch with one another.  I would want to be able to fully connect and get to know what my partner's deepest desires are in life.Self disclosure and comfortability are the most important factors for me when it comes to a date.  I don't need anything extravagant or any source of entertainment.  The only thing that I want to do on that date is communicate with the person that I am with.  I want to share thoughts and find different ways to grow as a couple.  Growth and change is the whole point of being in a relationship, for me.  Those who aren't busy being born are busy dying.The ideal date for what I am describing would probably be a simple dinner, whether it be in the comforts of my own home or a quite little restaurant.  If the date was located in a restaurant, I would prefer for the setting to be outside with plenty of greenery, low lighting, soft music, and under a starry night sky.  The food isn't as important to me, my date and I are willing to try any kind of food from any culture.  Our dinner would consist of open and honest conversation about our ideas for what we are doing here in this world, what we have to give as individuals, and what direction we want to be heading in our future.  After the dinner, we would go for a brisk walk enjoying the crip fall air.  The walk wouldn't have to contain any conversation as far as I am concerned.  The pleasure of each other's company and the appreciation of the beautiful night is enough said.  Maybe we stop by a nice pond and lay down to listen to the frogs and crickets play their beautiful song of the night.  The date continues with a thought provoking movie or a humorous tv show that gets a good laugh out of us both.  A glass of wine is possible during our show.  After the show we don't quite feel like going to bed, so I pour another glass of wine and put on the ""Another Side of Bob Dylan"" record.  The night starts to wind down and what follows is none of your business...That is the perfect date with my ideal partner."

Im a simple guy. I would love to spend the night, nothing gross or creepy just getting to sleep in the same bed with someone i care a lot about is the best feeling and getting to wake up with them!

Describing the specific details would raise my hopes up to the point where it would have to be perfectly in order to achieve that level of satisfaction, so simple and loose to small changes would be just perfect. Unfortunately, that's not enough so I will go into tremendous detail.First, it must be my place and the door must be white with a golden handle. The kitchen must have a marble counter with a gas stove because that is the best way to cook any meal. The windows must be to the ceiling and the couches must be dark red and made of leather. The meal must be vegetarian and the beverage of choice will be apple juice, no! Milk, 2% with a pinch of chocolate mix powder. The music must come from a Sony radio with two subs and it has to be heard clearly throughout the place where I live. The rest shall be up to faith on whether or not my date would actually show up because that is most likely than this abstraction of a fantasy coming true. Continuing on, let's just she happen to feel like a decent human being and decided to show up. The way she should be dressed would be in an all-white dress, hoop earrings, and all-white flat shoe, as to not scuff up the mahogany wooden floor I received as a gift from my late father-in-law who worked as a brewery employee. As she enters I notice her long curly black with blonde highlighted hair and compliment her on the way it carries and bounces with such volume. Once we exchange greetings, I escort her to the table made of Alaskan style glass and stainless steel legs. We sit down and eat an exquisite meal made from scratch, have an irregular conversation about of the time's politics then as the night progresses she grows tired due to the lighting and we soon retire to the bedroom where I give her an amazing massage and we both sleep in a California King size bed with White wolf imprinted sheets. So as we doze off into the dreams of the forever ever ending world of my imagination, I soothe her with my calming but masculine voice and as she closed her eyes to dream about a joyful run through the meadows of Montana I place my lips upon her forehead to wish upon her the best of luck to her with having an amazing night of slumber."

To accurately depict my perfect date with my girlfriend I will have to talk about a date that I could do in each state, and my favorite places in those states.In Montana describing my perfect date is very easy. I would want to introduce my girlfriend to my host family that I lived with in two years. My host family consisted of my mom (Monica) my dad (Paul) my little sister (Bella) and my younger brother (Asher). After I introduced her to the entire family I would want to take her on a hike in the East Ridge Mountains of Butte, Montana. The outdoors became a huge part of my life while living in Butte and I would want to show her how much I liked that aspect of living there. I would also show the Butte Community Ice Center where I ended my junior hockey career and started my hockey coaching career. In Minnesota I would want to take her to my favorite Italian restaurant in St. Paul, Minnesota. Yarusso's Italian restaurant is a place that really hits close to my heart because it reminds me so much of my family and my childhood. The restaurant is in the neighborhood that my mom and so many of my cousins grew up in. After dinner I would take her to the Xcel Energy Center to a Minnesota Wild game. The hockey aspect is something that I would definitely want her to understand. Here in Missouri I haven't really been able to explore much of Springfield other than campus area here at Missouri State University. But I think I'd want to explore St. Louis and head down to Ballpark Village area. Also I would want to check out some of the other main attractions in St. Louis like the arch and the zoo.The most important thing for me to make it a perfect date, would just be to spend time with someone and give them an inside look at the things and the places that make me who I am. There's quite a few different sides to me and I really would like for someone to understand and be able to relate to every single one of them. Of these three dates the one I would want to do the most would be the one that takes place in Montana, because of how many great people and memories I have there."

Nothing kills the mood for me more than having to come home from stressful classes/work or knowing I have a lot to do the next day. To start off the day I would run into some surprise money from family or possibly my job that could pay for this entire day! Then we would start out with a great lunch at one of our favorite local places in town before heading off to go do a fun, adventurous thing that afternoon, maybe go to the zoo or theme park or something of that sort. Something completely out of the ordinary and daily  that we would remember for years to come. Then I would surprise her with something unexpected such as buying her a present or going backstage with penguins. It would also be fun to drive to a big city or a place we have not been before and explore. It doesn't have to be Chicago big, just large enough that we will have plenty of new stores and local spots to visit! I distinctly remember dates we would go on early on in our relationship four years ago like when we would make a spontaneous trip to Columbia or the Lake and just explore or when we went to the St Louis Zoo or Worlds of Fun, which much like its name was a lot of fun! We would spend all day seeing/experiencing new things and having a great time with each other. Neither one of us would get calls from family or work and we would be having too much fun to check our phones or news. Then we would go to a fine dining restaurant and have a quiet, relaxing, and romantic meal. We would reminisce over all the fun we had and just look at each other fulling understanding the other's content and love. No stress, no homework, no job exhaustion; just true, natural content and love. Afterwards we would go to the movies and have a good time. Horror, comedy, suspense; doesn't matter to me as I just love going to the movies, especially with someone I love. Bonus points if she leans against me during the movie! After all that, we would return home and cuddle on the couch and Netflix and chill before eventually falling asleep together. Then we could wake up the next morning, get breakfast, and plan the next time we can do it all again!"

I can be very quiet and reserved until I start to open up, but I think I can carry  out a conversation pretty well, especially when I'm talking about something I'm passionate about where I can ramble on non-stop, so I would expect the same of my partner.Nothing makes me feel good like making people laugh, so someone who understands me and my sense of humor would be perfect. I don't get emasculated by who pays or who drives or anything like that, I would like it if we worked out a system where we alternate between who pays for each dinner so that we both split the burden equally. After dinner, we would go to one or another's place and just sit around and watch a movie/play video games/just talk about ourselves, our goals, our dreams, or just stuff we're interested in or passionate about. I am very much a homebody, and going to a place with a lot of bright flashing lights and loud music would make me anxious and uncomfortable. They would have to be understanding of that, if not also feel the same way. I get extremely uncomfortable when I'm made to sing or dance, whether in public or private, so karaoke or dancing is unfortunately out of the question. I wouldn't want to move too fast or rush into anything, and I'm still not very comfortable with my body or physical appearance, so romantic or sexual forays would stay limited until we're both ready. To further describe my ideal romantic partner, they would be someone of similar or greater intelligence than me, with a sense of humor and matching political beliefs and opinions. I'm not picky in terms of physical appearance (beggars can't be choosers, after all) but I do have a soft spot for girls with short hair. Height or weight also isn't a deciding factor, but I'd like them to be of similar age to me if not older, otherwise I'd feel uncomfortable dating someone much younger than I am. They would have to be kind and empathetic towards other people as I am. It would not work out at all if our views and beliefs were diametrically opposed to each other."

I would first surprise my girlfriend with tickets to Italy. Our date would take place on beach, under the sunset. I would dress very nicely, wearing a full suit. She would be dressed in a beautiful black dress, wearing the most intoxicating perfume ever created. I would greet her with a giant hug and kiss, and then we would sit down to a candle lit table. The waiter or waitress would approach us, asking for our drink orders.The great thing about this restaurant is that there is so many things on the menu. The menu consists of over 50 meals to choose from. We both make out choices, and then we talk for 30 minutes until our food arrives. We talk deeply about our relationship that we've built and where we are going. We talk about when we first met, and how far we've came leading up to that very day. We talk about how much we love each other more than we ever thought we could. We enjoy dinner and dessert, and then we lay in the sand, starring up at the sky. Everything about this moment is magical. It is a moment that will never be forgotten. The moment is so unbelievable that we don't even realize how much of a great time we are having. Phones are silent and we are completely embracing each others presence. I turn on some soft music, and we lay there in each others arms. The ideal date is completely peaceful, therapeutic, and simply enjoying every moment without problems. The perfect date is so hard to have because so many things could go wrong. In order to have the perfect date, you have to have the perfect connection with a person. In order to find that connection, there has to be a history. You and your partner must have been dating for multiple years in order to build that chemistry. You have to be dedicated to making sure the date goes as planned as well. A simple dinner and movie date could be the perfect date if people were determined enough to make it perfect. The challenge of each date is to make it perfect. I wonder how many people embrace that challenge, or do they actually care about making their date go amazingly? Do they have any motivation to make their date perfect. In order to make that perfect date both people have to give their all to each other, and stick together.   "

I want to try new food, new activities, and experience things from another point of view with the person I love. If I could pick a few places to go they would be: Paris, because I want to visit the Eiffel Tower and would love to eat authentic Italian food, Germany because I would like to visit all the old Nazi camps and museums because that's something that i have always found interesting, and Alaska, because I want to be able to see the Northern Lights and experience a time period where it is always sunny, or always dark. I would also love to go on a cruise to a tropical island. On this trip I would like to have many different stops maybe at Florida and the Bahamas. In the Bahamas I would like to take my date on a boat to a private island and swim with the dolphins. When we are on the ship I want to lay out on the pool deck during the days and drink with my girlfriend. I'd enjoy the buffets on the ship and all the activities that occur. I'd want to go to live performances. At other times when we dock I would like to take my girlfriend shopping and go exploring. I want to be able to see what the countries are like. On the ship I would like to meet a lot of new people and maybe even meet lifetime friends. Most of all I want to make sure that me and my girlfriend will make memories that will last forever. At night I'd like to go the bars on the ship, dance and just have a good time. I want our room to have a balcony. Every morning I would order room service and sit outside to watch the ocean with my girlfriend. I'd also like to go out there in some of the evenings with a glass of wine to watch the sunset. I want the bedroom to be big and spacious so that it's not crazy hard to get ready each morning. I want to make a lot of friends on this trip and be able to hang out with them each day with my girlfriend also. I want to print a lot of pictures from this trip so that I will always remember it. I'd  post about it all over my social media. After this I would definitely plan for future vacations with my girlfriend. My main goal is to make sure that she and I have the best time ever together and our relationship grows even stronger."

We grew up together, really. Her dad was my basketball trainer and we have been in the same small school from kindergarten, up until now in college. We have been on thousands of dates, doing thousands of different things, from just going to the movie theater, to being launched in the air on a ""slingshot"" ride. It is very hard to say the absolute perfect date because we both love doing so much stuff, but I do have one in mind i would love to do. I would have to start the day early because i know she loves taking a whole day to go out and do stuff together. We would probably start by having a small breakfast at our favorite cafe in our hometown. We always get the same thing, which is biscuit with gravy on top and hash browns on top of that. We always split it because shes full after two bites. After we ate breakfast we would go shopping and walk the strip. I know along the way somewhere I would have to get her a coke and a pickle, those are her favorite things. We would also play a game of mini golf, we are a competitive couple and we keep track of our wins and losses in mini golf. I would try and take lots of pictures for her, she loves pictures. Mostly the fact that she can go back and look at those moments forever. From the area we are in there is a ""cruise"" boat that goes around the lake, i would love to take her on a date on that boat. It would have to be the evening cruise so we could have dinner on the boat and watch the sun set and the stars come out together. We try and do that every night, it is hard trying to weigh in the time for that, but i know she would love seeing it from the boat. I would hope to have a candle lit dinner with some daises, those are also her favorite. We would go to the top deck and lay down together looking at the stars and talking about anything from when we plan to get married, to the latest TV show we are watching at the time. I would surprise her with some type of jewelry and chocolate as we are enjoying the night together. Then after it was all done and we were on our way home i would have to stay and watch greys anatomy with her until she fell asleep. She hates going to bed alone."

I would first get ready and wear something pretty nice so she would be happy and then go pick her up.  I would have to wash my car and clean it really good to make it look nice.  It is an old car so if i clean it up good she would be blown away by it.  Also maybe fix a few things on it beforehand just in case to make it so it does not have any problems.  I would get her flowers before the date but nor roses because everyone gets roses so they would be daisys because she loves those.  I would take her to a lot of different places such as the art museum and walk around forest park going to different cool places around there.  If it was cold that time of year then we could go ice skating at the place by there because ice skating is fun and neither of us are probably that good at it. After  i would take her to a very fancy restaurant.  I'm not sure which one i would probably ask her before but if she wanted me to choose i would find a place.  So i would take her to dinner and then get some really good food and a salad.  I would try and make her laugh the whole time.  After that i would pay for the dinner and she would let me pay for it and not try and pay for it because i am the man so i should pay for it.  After dinner i would take her somewhere really cool either in forest park with lot of lights or go to mainstreet.  But once it go a little later and dark outside i would take her back to the country where i live and probably go star gazing and maybe lay on the hood of my car because it is huge or get the truck and lay in that.  I also have a hammock so we could lay in that.  We would probably talk for a long time about life and stuff.  We would probably be out there for a long time just being outside because i like being outside.  After that we could go back to my house and watch a movie.  Preferably a comedy because i love comedies.  I would probably fall asleep during the movie because movies put me to sleep when i am tired.  She would spend the night at my house and then the next morning we would get up and go get coffee and breakfast at the original pancake house.  They have the best bacon pancake and bacon so i would definitely get that.  They also have gluten free pancakes for her because she can not have gluten so its the best for both of us.

When all the Christmas lights are up, and when everyone is in a festive mood. Walking close to each other to stay warm, with warm drinks. Maybe go watch a movie at one of the theaters. And then go eat dinner at an exclusive restaurant and take a scenic drive to the cliffs at Jacoma Lake. Take a late night walk through the woods, it's scary at first but the destination is beautiful. It's a cliff that overlooks the lake. Sit down and talk about life, learn about each other. Maybe have a deep conversation about where we came from or something. Then when we get to cold head back home and start the fireplace. Nap by the fire and maybe see where the night takes us from there ;). When it?s cold outside you just want to hold on to each other but at the same time enjoy the snow and all the festivities. On the car rides to each destination would also be a big part of the date, listening to the right music and talking with the right person. Maybe even skip one of the destinations on a spontaneous decision to go somewhere else. It?s not about the places you go as much as it?s about who you?re with and how you vibe with them. Every place becomes something special because of a memory and the person you can make the most valuable memories with is what makes a perfect date. I do not have a lot more to say about this. Everything i already wrote was my honest opinion. I just want to spend time with my significant other and have a spontaneous day that turns into something that I can remember as an ""perfect date"". I've had plenty dates I would consider perfect in the past and each one doesn't preside the other. They each were perfect for who I was with. Those are the dates that really stand out and that I value. So in conclusion a perfect date would be one that I can't think about off the top of my head but rather something that can stand out in my mind as one of the dates we've ever had. And I really like festivities. I also really enjoy being with the person I love in any and every way. Whatever activities we do it'll be something I enjoy as long as I'm with a girl I vibe with. This is me describing my perfect date in 300 words."

I do not know who my idea romantic partner is or is like. But, I do have a decent scenario of how I would want it to go. First of all, Whenever I go in this date, I hope I am a lot more financially stable, because this is going to get very expensive, yet priceless. I would like my perfect date to be three days long, just because you will see In a second why. So For our date, we will start by waking up the day before we leave for our three day excursion and eat a very delicious breakfast at a 5 star breakfast place in New York on a perfect temperature fall day. We must get completely different things so I can try some of her food though. We will obviously have our conversations about how fun out three day trip is going to be. We will then go back to our place and chill for a while. After chilling, we will pack our overly packed bags in my expensive car and head to the airport to go to our destination in Belgium, Germany. Before we leave, we take a brownie edible to sleep for our long flight. Once we land, we will immediately go get all of the classic German food and eat until we want to throw up. After we are done eating, go check into our hotel where we will be staying for the nest three days. We get everything situated and then take a very nice nap. After our naps, shower and get ready to go to Tomorrowland, a music festival in Belgium. We will immediately go to the water stations and fill our camelbacks with water. Then, go to the nearest food station to try out the delicious food they have to offer. After that, go to the first stage that we want to see whoever it is that is there we plan on seeing. Dance super hard because we just got there and had a very long flight in to Germany. After the first person, we start walking to the next stage, as well as talk about how amazing the person we saw was. After that, We then dance away to more amazing music. I then wait till a very emotional moment and make out with her to create an amazing memory, so every time I hear that song I will think of that very moment when I was kissing my ideal romantic parter who is super duper sexy. She has to be blonde and have an amazing very easy and unique personality inside and out. She also has to like the same kind of music I am listening to at the festival. But back to the festival "

This date would be one for the books because it is going to be an all day and night thing. This date would be an adventure filled journey with life-changing experiences and obstacles that we would go through together and take pictures doing the adventures. I would later give her the pictures that we took. In the morning, I would make us breakfast on the beach and we would feed the seagulls with bread, trying not get bit by one of them. Eggs and bacon would be sizzling in a pan that I would bring and I would start a fire as well, hoping to stay warm in early morning hours. We would also have freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh fruit from a nearby market to enjoy. After breakfast, we would go shopping for her favorite clothes and shoes around the beach. We would also eat lunch at a restaurant of her choice on the beach. During the day, my girl and I would learn how to surf and windsurf. We would practice until we felt like we were professionals and then we would go deep sea fishing. After catching a few fish, I would store them in the boat and we would go parasailing on the same deep sea fishing boat. I would take pictures with our Nikon camera of us parasailing over the Pacific Ocean and give my girl the pictures for a memory. After all of this, we would head back to the beach and I would set us up a tent to take a nice afternoon nap in with plenty of pillows and blankets. The tent would have a lock on it because we do not want any homeless people waking us up or anyone messing with us. We would wake up late afternoon and start surfing again, hopefully not forgetting what we learned earlier in the day by a professional. At night, I would build us a fire and we would sip wine and roast marshmallows talking about our next romantic date and where it should be. We would then see who can run the fastest on the beach to and from the water touching the water and coming back to our tent. I would end the date by asking her a few questions to see if she is interested in me and I would definitely give her a dozen roses and some chocolates, also a kiss or two. "

I would go pick her up around five or six and have the whole night planned out.  We would always ride to the place in my truck making it feel more romantic to me.  I like to be a old school kinda guy on dates so all my attention is on making her happy and making her feel like it is only her night.  We would go to a nice dinning place and order way to expensive food and some beverages.  The food needs to be neat clean food nothing sloppy.  With candles on the table to be corny, maybe even do the whole feeding each other thing. All in the plan of the night. Give her lots on compliments but not overdoing it, just make her feel special. If we dont go to a resturaunt then we would go out on a picnic by a lake.  Most of the meal is spent talking and connecting not really focused on the food.  Our phones are left in the truck so we don't have any kind of distractions.  The only thing need for the night is our company. Even if we did not have the money do go out somewhere nice we would be together somewhere doing something.  After we are done we can go on a nice ride through some back roads just listing to music and talking about anything The back roads are nice because you can watch the stars and really feel in sink with nature. While driving around normally we talk about our deep thoughts or just look around the nice views.  Might go around down town to see all the lights. If not in the truck then on forewheelers just riding around real slow. Maybe go fast a few times to scare her. I really like just spending time even if we are not talking making contact like holding hands is good makes me feel more connected to them.  If we can we would go see some kind of show or play or somekind of entertainment.  We would not get back home until late at night. When we do we brake out some home made wine to sip on.  When we get back home its fun to watch a movie that we both really like and cuddle.  The cuddling normally leads to more because we both love each other and kinda feel it, it is always nice to cap it off with making woopie.  Once we finish that normally we would lay in bed all wrapped up until we fall asleep.  "

I would love to take my girl out or my ""romantic partner"" to a nice fancy restaurant. Yes, the cliche. I would want to dress fancy and wear something that my partner will find me in attractive. The ideal time of the day would be dinner time and would include on a day that is somewhat special, like anniversary or mine or my partner's birthday. I think the ideal date would be ideal if it is done on a special day that has a meaning to me or my partner. I would pick my partner up from her house or wherever she lives. Picking her up in my car would make it more special and ideal. After I pick her up, going to the restaurant with a reservation booked ahead of time. Ordering good food and having a few glasses of wine would make it more ideal. After we are done eating, going out to watch a movie. I think that would be nice to watch a movie that I and my partner is interested in watching. During the movie,  I would like to hold her hand or put my hand around her. After we are done watching the movie, going out to get ice cream from Andy's frozen custard.  They by far have the best ice cream that I have ever eaten. Afte we get the ice cream, going to a park to just walk around, hold hands and eat our ice cream. One of the things I love to do is to just walk around the park during the night and look at the stars. I will love to camp out in the park with my partner and spend the night. Wake up early in the morning and before the sun rises and watches the sunrise. As the sun rises, I would kiss my partner and hold one of her hands. As the day continues, I would go out with my partner and do many things like going for a hike or going out to get some breakfast. Even working out would make my date more ideal and enjoyable. Say after we workout, go back home and get cleaned up. After we get cleaned up, change into nice comfy clothes and watch a movie at the house or cuddle. Cuddling is one of my favorite things to do so it would definitely be a priority. With that being said, what I have described would be my perfect ideal date and something I would love to adventure one day with my romantic partner. "

Greet the girl with a hug, maybe a kiss. I would hold the door of the car open because I am a gentleman. We would go to lunch or dinner where I would buy the meal. After the meal we would go to the movies, maybe do a little cuddling and kiss a couple times. When the movie is over I would take the girl to get some dessert. Then, I would drive her home, maybe kiss in the car for awhile. Finally I would walk her to her door, hug her, and let her know I will text her when I arrived home. When I arrive home, I would text her of course and try to plan the next date. Depending on the girl I would make suggestions for a date and run the ideas past her. Of course, I would let the girl choose where to go and what to do on the date if she wanted to. The movie is optional but the restaurant that we went to would be a pretty nice place and I would let her order whatever she wanted. The perfect date would be phone free with all of the attention directed at each other. Hopefully laughs would be shared and the girl would enjoy herself. It would be very important that the girl is happy the whole time and that would tell me that I did a great job keeping her attention and that she really likes me. In the end her happiness is the most important thing. In the follow up conversation I would make sure that she actually enjoyed her time. I suppose if I had been dating the girl for some time she would allow me inside when I walk her to the door. I think the ideal end to a perfect date night would be staying the night with the girl. An added perk would be sleeping with her but only if we had been dating for awhile and she was asking. Happiness and consent are probably the two most important points in a romantic/sexual relationship. I think that having sex with a significant other after a date is the ultimate goal in today's society and the culture of the United States. Like I said, this is an added perk but not a necessity. In a romantic relationship it seems like the guy does all the work, spends all the money, and is in charge of making sure every date is super romantic and runs flawlessly. In my experience happiness is everything in a romantic relationship and if your significant other is not happy, you better find a way to make her happy very quickly or you will not enjoy your life. You may even be a single man if you can't plan great dates and keep the woman happy."

I guess the ideal girl would be under 5 foot 10 inches (because I'm 6 foot 1 inch), smooth skin, long brown hair, and laughs at my jokes. I think face and personality are the two most attractive assets on a female, so the other physical characteristics are not as important.    On television it seems like every date consists of dinner, movie, and then sex, but I don't think I would want to do any of those. A perfect date would not consist of eating a formal dinner at a restaurant,  because I am a very picky eater and I would not want there to be any weird moments because I don't like any food. I also would not go on a date to a movie because dates are so you can have fun and get to know each other better and I don't think sitting silently during a movie would accomplish that. And for the sex part, I assume we are talking about a perfect first date so I wouldn't do that on a first date.  A perfect date for me would probably be going to a Royals game, or some other sporting event with people we are both friends with. I think this would be a perfect place because my ideal partner would like sports (or at least act like she does), the sporting event would provide something to talk about in case there was an awkward silence, and going with a group of people would also keep awkward silences from coming up.    After the game I would take my ideal partner to Waffle House. I know I mentioned that I wouldn't want to take her to dinner because I am a picky eater, but I don't really consider Waffle House a formal dinner, and I love waffles so I would eat there. At this point, it would just be me and her because if it were our first date, then being with our group of friends during the Royals game would have broken the ice and there would be no more awkwardness between us.    Ideally, throughout the night we were making each other laugh and having a good time. The date I described is basically what me and my friends do in the summer, and this is no coincidence. My friends and I do activities we enjoy like watching baseball, and eating below average breakfast food at 1AM. If I were to date a girl, I don't think I would like her unless she also enjoyed baseball and waffles and other activities that I enjoy. My perfect date isn't limited either: I would also enjoy a night at the bowling alley or maybe a round at the mini golf course. But like I mentioned at the beginning, I've never been on a date so pretty much anything would be perfect."

Dinner could be almost anywhere, because I like most food. Although I would like a less formal restaurant to eat at, something casual like Texas Roadhouse or Buffalo Wild Wings or something. This way we can both wear comfortable clothes and be in a casual, comfortable environment. This time allows us to eat and also talk about each other's interests, values, hobbies, etc. We would be able to get to know each other while eating good food, and maybe having a few drinks, once we are both old enough. Then, after dinner, we would go see a good movie, preferably a Marvel movie or Star Wars or anything of that nature. I always think a movie is a good idea for after dinner, just in case you start to run out of conversational topics. The movie allows a break where your focus isn't necessarily off of each other, but you do get to escape for a little while. And since my perfect partner also enjoys these types of movies, it is something we are both still able to enjoy separately, while still being on a date meant for the two of us. Then after the movie we could hang out and talk about what we just saw and continue any conversation we had started earlier. This could mean grabbing a Hurts doughnut or just walking around the city. It would be something that could energize us a bit after sitting in the movie for so long. We could end the night on the couch playing video games and just relaxing at home. Most likely we would be playing a co-op game like Call of Duty or the new Battlefront game, something violent, or at least some game that we could play together. We would then go to bed and binge watch a tv show while we fall asleep. I like watching animated comedies like Archer or American Dad while I go to sleep, so my partner would hopefully be ok with that. It would be a fairly long date night, but would be filled with time learning about each other and having fun. Anything physical would neither be unwanted nor specifically sought after. If anything happens, it happens, but it will not make the night any less enjoyable if it doesn't. Overall, the date would be very casual and laid back, I wouldn't want any part of it to feel stressful and we would get to spend a large amount of time together. "

The best date I've had, by far, was, surrprisingly enough, with a girl with whom I matched on Tinder. Let's call her Kelly. I was working at summer camp, it was towards the end of the summer and there was only about a week left before the staff left. I use Tinder primarily as a method to alliviate boredom and so I have my distence set faily high. When I saw Kelly's profile it was much like any other; there were a few flattering pictures, she was very beatiful, and a short, faily typical bio. Two things stood out to me though; one, we were mutually facebook friends with my sister, and two, she had in her bio something about how she only swips right if your profile catches her attention, which I saw as a challenge. I swiped right and I think a day or two later we matched. I asked her what about my profile caught her attention and she told me it was most because of my sister and it turned out that she was my older sister's little sister in their sorority. which we both thought was hilarious. We hit it off and talked as if we had been friends for years and even jokingly started planning our wedding. We decided that we wanted to meet. Our date  was a friday which was the last day that I was at the summer camp. This camp was near Springfield, she lived in Waynesville, and I lived in Jefferson City. My idea was to go on this date sort of on my way home from camp. We planned to get dinner and movie but I was done at camp a bit before noon so I asked her if I could come over and just hang out for a couple hours before the movie and she said yeah. So we were at her house talking and playing video games and I was having the best time of my life. the game she was showing me was very emotional and we really bonded over it. We went to see our movie and held hands through out the whole thing. When we went back to her place it was late and we hadn't eaten yet so she started cooking dinner. We ate together, finished the sad video game, and went to bed together aroung two in the moring. I'm asexual so I never tried anything. We never really talked about it but I think it made her like me more. We spent most of the morning on her bedroom floor talking. There was one point where we were rolling around on the floor together and she ended up proped up on top of me and I leaned up and kissed her. It wasn't that big of a deal, just a quick peck on the lips, but it was my first kiss and I'll never forget it. We ended up getting lunch together and kissed one more time before I left. The whole date lasted twenty four and a half hours and wasone of the best things I have ever experienced. The only thing I wished is that we lived closer together and were still able to date. We're still friends but we live ninety minutes away and we're both broke college students. We tried it and it just didn't work."

Even if all we do is the typical, dinner and movie, it is really all about the connection you have. The best dates are the ones where conversations come up organically and are actually a little bit more deep than just what my major is. Forced small talk is one of my biggest pet peeves. It's also very important that we each have the same intentions. When I am looking for something not very serious and she is looking for something serious, or visa versa, then it definitely gets in the way of developing a good chemistry with someone. For me it can kind of feel like wasted time when our goals aren't aligned which does not make for a good date. One of my favorite dates actually involved a little bit of trespassing. I'm from the Lake of the Ozarks and i know of a few scenic spots to go look at the lake and have a good conversation. I had been hanging out with this girl for awhile and there wasn't any pressure to really go on a typical date and she was fairly new to the lake area so we were just driving around and i was sort of a tour guide, showing her some of the sights. It was almost dusk so i decided to show her one of my favorite spots. It is right by a restaurant on a cliff-side called the Blue Heron. We pulled into the Blue Heron road and right before you go through the gate there is a road that is blocked off with concrete barriers and trees and there are a few signs that says no trespassing. It was a short walk but for someone who has never been there and was doing something illegal it probably seemed like it took forever. Once we got there we jumped down a ledge and just sat down with our feet hanging off the ledge. we had conversations about life goals, religion, politics, and all kinds of deep stuff. Even when it was quiet it was a comfortable quiet. There were not any forced conversations or mindless small talk. The only problem with that date was the fact that i did not want anything serious because i was about to move to Springfield for school and more importantly i had only been single for about a month after breaking up with my girlfriend of four year. She did want to have something serious and our difference in intentions was a little bit of a roadblock in our relationship.     "

Assuming that I like this girl a lot and I have feelings for her, I would want to take her to a nice Italian resturant. We would both get dressed up in formal clothes. I would go pick her up from her house around 7pm. Then, I would compliment her and tell her she looks great when we are driving to the restaurant. We are both singing the lyrics to a popular song. We get to the restaurant and I let her order whatever she wants; it is a 5 course meal. I am being so funny, charming, and she thinks I am smart. This girl is a huge baseball fan and she wants to come to all the games and be my biggest fan. So, we finish our meal around 8:30. Then, we go see a movie with a love story so she likes it and Mark Wahlberg is in it so I can enjoy it too. We order a large popcorn and all the candy that she wants.For some reason we get a lot of energy; we want to have a party tonight. We both invite all of our friends over to my house. The music is turned up and everyone is having a great time. At this time, she thinks I am a lot of fun and the life of the party. I want the get to know her better though, so we go on the roof of my house with a blanket just to talk and stare at the stars. I get to know all about her and her crazy family. I get to know what she likes to do and what she is afraid of. She learns the same about me. She curls up next to me because it starts getting cold outside. I put my arm around her. She eventually looks up at me with her gleaming eyes and I lean in to kiss her. She kisses me back and asks if we can go on another date soon. I drive her home around 11. As soon as she gets home she goes right to her bed, cuddles up underneath the covers, and has the biggest smile on her face because she really likes me. On my way back to my house I start to think if I can have a future with this girl. I start thinking about what it would be like in 5 years. I get back to my house and everyone is drunk, so I kick them all out. I go in my backyard and get into my hot tub. I take a 20 minute power nap and feel very relaxed. I go inside my backdoor and my dogs are there to greet me. My house is trashed but there is leftover pizza on the table. I put in the microwave and eat a few slices. I turn on ESPN and watch football highlights for the day. Then, I call this girl and tell her goodnight."

If all of our interests are the same, then where does that get us. No interesting conversations about our days and a lot of ""Oh that's right, you were there too"" kind of conversations. Instead, I want someone who can open me up to new experiences and passions, making me and them more rounded people.My perfect date with the ideal romantic partner would first consist of dinner. What we ate would't really matter, as long as there was stimulating conversation. Ideally, he would talk and I would listen, as I tend to talk too much. I really want to talk about things that matter, like genuine interests and hobbies, as embarrassing as they may be. Then, if everything went well, I'd like to go see a movie. But not to ""go see a movie"" , implying ulterior motives, but to actually go and spend time with the person. I want to nurture a meaningful connection between us and I don't want to jeopardize by moving things too quickly. Honestly, I think the idea of rushing to sex on the first date is kind of destructive to the blooming relationship and I am not that kind of guy. Ideally, the movie would be a comedy or a rom-com. I don't want a movie that is too serious, because I want us to have a good time. After the movies, I would take him for ice cream and continue to talk and have meaningful dialogue. We would probably go somewhere like Andy's and of course I would buy him some custard because I'm a true gentleman. If this is my ideal partner, then we are already really good friends. That would make it easier to connect with them on an emotional level. Also, being friends with him already would get rid of the awkward getting to know you part of the date. After ice cream, I would invite him over to my place and watch something on Netflix. Again, I don't want to rush anything, but instead I just want want to be around him some more. We would probably watch several episodes of the Office and snuggle up on the couch. This is because everyone likes the Office. Then, as he went to leave, I would give him a kiss goodnight and that would be the end of the date."
98,Micah Gray,Male,18,White,5,2,5,5,3,4,4,5,4,2,4,1,4,5,5,4,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,4,5,5,4,3,5,4,2,4,5,5,5,5,2,1,4,5,1,1,4,3,2,5,2,5,1,4,"I think a perfect date matters more about the person than it does the activity. If you're doing something with someone you love, you'll love what you're doing. I'm planning a big date with the cutest girl I've ever met (Blair), and since I know she loves the outdoors like I do, I'm planning on going hiking with her in Fayetteville, but not after we run by chik-fil-a. Then we're going downtown to walk around some shops and just chill out together and then we'll see the new Thor movie in a nice theatre in town. Finally, we'll end by going back to her campus (she goes to John Brown University) and I'll teach her some basic piano lessons. No, that's not a euphemism, she actually wants to learn piano, and since I've played for all my life, it makes sense to me.I can honestly say that the best bonding experiences I've ever had with dates has been sharing our faith with each other. Whether or not you believe in Christianity, simply sharing religious experiences brings people closer together in my opinion. We have our faith in common and it's such a deep connection that we can share with each other, which is something I value quite a bit.My ideal romantic partner is someone who, first and foremost, loves God more than anything else, and she has to be the kind of person who's willing to go to Taco Bell. I don't mean that in a literal sense, but I need someone that's more concerned with spending time with me as a person than they are about what I can physically bring to the table, whether that be in terms of money, or even just fun activities. I won't always be able to provide a spectacular list of activities, so the person I date (and am currently dating) has to be ok with that. I also need someone that's at least slightly extroverted, because I tend to be introverted and it makes sense--so far, that's working out.Not to mention I want someone who's smart. I want someone who has a passion for life and an inquisition that a lot of people don't have. I want someone who has a strong work ethic and a desire to improve--stagnation is pointless. I want someone who can improve right along side me as I figure out life. For me, the gauge of that is someone that brings me closer to Christ. I believe relationships were given to us to glorify God, and if they don't do that, they're a waste of time."

From their I would take her to sushi because sushi is my favorite food. That would only be an appetizer though after sushi we would go to a very good steakhouse because that is my second favorite food. I would try to plan the date on a warm clear sky type of night, because those are the best. After dinner I would take her to go play mini golf at a very fun park or something of that nature. I would play till I was completely exhausted, finally I would round the night out with going to see a scary movie or a thriller, it is the best way to spend a long day. After the movies I would stop at dairy queen and get a blizzard those are easily my favorite things to eat in the summer. With all of that being done I would go home and spend the rest of the night in bed and watch a sports game or something of that nature so I could fall asleep well. I do not ever go on dates so this is sort of a tough thing that I have to describe. My dream date would be in San Diego on the beach somewhere. I love that place and that would be the only place I would want to have it. The second place I would want to have the date is somewhere in the mountains of colorado. That would be a perfect scene and a beautiful place to have a picnic. If my date was in colorado I would start the day and take her to a colorado rockies game because I am a huge baseball fan and that would be awesome. After the game I would take her to get dinner at a unique place and eat something new because that is also my style. I would probably try to eat at like a asian place because my girlfriend is part asian so she would help me choose something that is very good. After dinner is over I would go to back and drive out into the mountains just to explore, Colorado is full of amazing natural resources so I would try to take her on a hike and maybe camp out. I would build a fire and we could roast marshmellows in the fire. After that I would turn a movie on netflix and my laptop then would lay in my tent and fall asleep. We would wake up and then watch the sunset over the mountains because that is something you only get to see once in your lifetime if you are not from that area. "

I feel as Christmas is the best time to go out on a date because there is a lot more joy in the air and many festive things to go out and do. My ideal romantic partner would in my eyes would be someone who is decently tall and athletic. She needs to have good sense of humor and is very close with her family as family is a very important part of my life. Along with having a good family my friends and family need to love her just as much as I do because they will be around her a lot as well.  She would have to love dogs because I have a little puppy right now who will be around for a while the ideal date would probably start by going ice skating. While we were ice skating we would drink some hot chocolate. After ice skating we would walk around and go shopping for our families or whomever we need to get gifts for still. After we got done shopping we could go back to the truck and drive around down town and admire all the Christmas lights. At some point in time we would go get a bite to eat at a nice restaurant that we are already dressed up for. After dinner, my date and I would go back to the house and sit on the floor in front of the fireplace and warm up. We would turn on the hallmark channel and watch cheesy Christmas movies. As we were watching the movies my dog would be running around and messing with us as we played with her. I don?t need super extravagant date to have fun, as long as I would be with my girlfriend and friends life would be good............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

You can never really go wrong with a meal. The dinner itself doesn't have to be anything too special or expensive. I would rather it be a bit cheaper because the person I am with is the one that matters. As long as she is happy, then I am happy. After dinner, we would head to either a concert or a stand-up show. I love music so a concert would be a fun time where we can just enjoy some good music and just let the stress and worries go. The genre of music doesn't matter to me as I listen and enjoy every type of music. I find joy with any type of music. If I had to choose a band, I would pick a rock cover band as I grew up loving classic rock and roll. A stand-up show would also be a fun alternative to concert. Comedy helps me relax and it takes my mind off of any problems that I are on my mind. The comedian doesn't really matter either. If I had to chose one, it would probably Gabriel Iglesias or Dave Chappelle (if even still does stand-up). After the concert or comedy show, we would head to one of our places and just relax and watch a movie or TV show on Netflix. I do not have really any preference on what it is. After that, we would either go to sleep or I would take her home. That concludes my perfect date. It may seem like it is not very specific as I have never really put much thought into the perfect date. To me, as long as my date is happy, then I am happy. I am more go with the flow and work a better when I get to kind of improvise than have a set schedule. Risking sounding clich?, if she is the ideal partner, then any date where she is happy is perfect enough for me. As for my ideal partner, I would have to say it would be a female as I am attracted to the opposite gender. Personality is the most important thing to me. We should have similar interest and compatible personality. Ideally, she would be kind, funny, and relaxed while also being driven to accomplish her dreams. Personality is great but she gets extra points if she is also physically attractive (This makes me seem kind of shallow). She should be someone who I could never get tired of talking with her or seeing her. She also needs to know how to handle me and not get tired of me."

The more comfortable both people are more inviting and aren't worried about how they look. When I go on dates I like to drive around and talk. Talking is one of my favorite things to do. There is no better way to get to know someone then just casual conversation, if the conversation gets into deeper content that is okay to. Emotional conversations can be great to know how each other feel in certain situations. I like to do one of two things when I get to the city or maybe even both. Go to the movies or to a new restaurant I haven't ate before. Trying new things is something I enjoy because I like to experience new environments. Going out to eat is a good place to be able to just sit down and have more good conversation while also eating good food. The movies are a good place to just chill out and watch a good film with someone that you really like. When picking a movie, I always like to ask if there is anything out she is really wanting to see, if not then you can?t ever go wrong with a comedy. Once we are done eating or watching the movie I like to drive home and listen to music once again. Music is something I enjoy for a little back ground music. When I am in a good mood I like to sing to it because it?s fun. I am an awful singer, so it makes it funny and I enjoy making others laugh. Then I ask if she would like to go to my house or to hers and hang out with my family or hers. I like to hang out with my parents. My parents have always been kind to girls I have been in relationships with. I really appreciate that they are really open to my friends and like to join in conversation when I have people over. If I go to her house I like to meet her family and if I already have then I like to talk to them and get to know them more. I think a good relationship with parents help them trust you more as a relationship. That is my ideal date with my romantic partner.     jhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"

That person is someone who I haven't met or though of yet. The experience I have had with most of my past ex's is that they are people that I just really wanted to spend time with. Most were all cool and unique in their own way and I wish most of them the best. So my ideal partner would just be someone who has a lot of hobbies, has a real passion for a certain thing I don't much care what it is so long as they have a real passion for it. That they live their own life, are fairly open-minded to new ideas and likes having their ideas challenged and can defend them on any day of the week. I would also hope that she is fairly attractive black hair would be nice. What would I do with the ambiguous person; honestly not way too much. First I say we go on the louis and Clark trail down 94 its a beautiful trail that I really like pick each others brains for an hour or so I would probably take them to corner 17 in St. Louis its a pretty expensive Chinese restaurant that I really love. Wander around the central west end grab a small somethin for desert and then just chill at her apartment see where she lives get a feel for the place. I really like to see how people design and style their homes. I guess if she was ideal she would have quite a bit of art maybe a movie poster or two see her book collection. That's kind of random but it would be cool then watch whatever she wants to preferably a movie I haven't seen or that shes passionate about. Then cuddle and go to bed. Why this is a perfect date to me is honestly just  because its a really long exposure time and usually I don't get to choose and they go to my house and I have to clean and shit its annoying sometimes I get to pick the place but for some reason people have a vendetta against Chinese its not way too fancy but its nice to me. Also I really haven't thought of my favorite partner because I get along with most everyone and I don't like people doing the exact same shit as me its kind of weird. I like learning about others not hearing about the exact same shit I hear from my friends. So it all really comes down to the person and what they do and I just want it to be different and unique. also take the character count off these things it makes people ramble for no reason"

I am take joy in the little things and anything to do with my partner almost always makes me happy. I would say a perfect date would start out by shopping around at many different locations. I like stores like Lulu Lemon, Academy, Macys ect. I enjoy buying new things and make humor out of most situations. I love just being able to walk around and stop by different stores all while being able to be around my girlfriend. During the shopping period I would see her stop a look at a certain thing and really enjoy it and I would make a note to myself as to what it is. Then later on I would buy it for her and surprise her with that item. As we are walking around I would stop and buy her a small gift like flowers or her favorite candy.  Then we would go and eat and an higher end restaurant and take time just talking and making joke. I would make sure she orders what she wants no matter what the price. I enjoy as we just sit there without our phones waiting on our food and just talking to each other about anything and everything. Usually the place we go eat has steak so I order the filet and devour it when it comes down.  After that we would go to a different place close by for some dessert or something of that sort. It is nice doing this because again we just get to take our time and walk, forgetting about anything else we have to do in the world and looking forward to our desserts and getting back home. I would pick somewhere with ice cream and cheesecake because it is her favorite. We would sit there and eat it and afterword?s we would ask someone to take our picture of us all dressed up and full. Then we would start to drive home. I love driving with her because she shares the same taste in music as I do and we just make a fool of ourselves while we dance and sing. She is an amazing singer though I rarely get to hear her actual voice, but when I do my heart stops and my ears open while my mouth drops in aw.   To end the date would be to go back to one of our houses and just change out of dress clothes and into something more comfortable. We would pop some pop corn and get some of our favorite drinks. With all the blankets and pillows gathered up we would sit and ask each other what they wanted to watch and take some time picking. It is late but not to bad so we would be able top get one or two movies in. I love just being able to lay there with her all cuddled up next to me. She usually can?t make it past the first movie so she will doze off with her head on my chest and my arm around her. It is just so comfy and warm. As she lays there sound asleep I would chose another movie of my liking to watch. Usually I can?t make it all the way through the second movie so I will fall asleep not even realizing it. When I wake up to the main menu of the movie playing over and over again I pick her up and began to carry her to bed. Laying down and sleeping next to her is a great ending to a perfect romantic date.   "

If I had to choose a meal, I would choose some kind of seafood or pizza. For instance, I would pick a girl up in formal, but not too formal clothing, say a dress shirt with nice jeans/chino pants. That way, I'm still pretty comfortable while still gaining some mad style points. My car would be spotless inside and out, showing her that I'm a man of cleanliness and preparation, as well as showing her her importance. Then, we would go get some seafood, probably a chain restaurant because you don't find many local spots in Missouri. If I could be picky, I would choose a low light dinner; that being said, I still want to see my food and date. I would definitely order a desert of her choice (of course). That being said, she better choose something chocolate-based or I'll be slightly hurt. Now if we're talking pizza, I'd take her to a local Italian restaurant and order a whole pizza for both of us, preferably pepperoni and veggies with a side salad. I love to eat slow and just enjoy the meal, so I would want to be at dinner for about an hour or so. Since I'm picturing this date in September, I'd want to go on a walk with her and talk more, along with the reason that food digests better when walking after you eat. After we walk a bit and the sun begins to set, I'd take her to either a movie or live show. If it were my preference, I'd take her to something comedic or scary. I definitely would not do an inappropriate comedy because that's just awkward for everyone; nor would I do an extremely gory movie (like Saw). Heck, I'd even to a Quentin Tarentino movie. Although a Tarentino movie might not set ""the mood"", I'm not trying to round first base anyways. I can't say I've ever been to a live show, so I'm not one hundred percent sure on what that would look like. I will say that from what I've seen on TV and through social media, I can rightly assume that they are romantic. After the movie, I would drive her back to her house, all while jamming out to some killer tunes so she sees my weird side. Then I would tell her how much I enjoyed the date, and would leave her house to go back to mine. And don't you worry, I would text her back if she was the one."
